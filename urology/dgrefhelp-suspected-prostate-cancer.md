# Suspected Prostate Cancer (2WW)

This pathway is for the **urgent suspected cancer referral** of men with symptoms or signs suggestive of prostate cancer.

{: .important }
> **Do not delay referral** in cases of a hard, irregular prostate on DRE.
>
> PSA testing should be postponed for **at least 1 month** after treatment of a proven urinary infection.

## 2WW Referral Criteria

Refer urgently via the **Suspected Prostate Cancer (2WW)** pathway if:

1.  **Abnormal DRE:** Prostate feels malignant (hard, irregular, craggy, or asymmetrical) on digital rectal examination.
2.  **Elevated PSA:** PSA level is above the age-specific reference range (see table below) in men with symptoms.

### Age-Specific PSA Thresholds (NICE NG12)

| Age (years) | PSA Threshold (ng/mL) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **< 40** | Use clinical judgement |
| **40 – 49** | > 2.5 |
| **50 – 59** | > 3.5 |
| **60 – 69** | > 4.5 |
| **70 – 79** | > 6.5 |
| **> 79** | Use clinical judgement* |

*\*In men aged >80, prostate cancer is very common and often indolent. Referral is generally only appropriate if the cancer is likely to be significant enough to require treatment or palliation, taking into account comorbidities and life expectancy.*

## Indications for Assessment (PSA + DRE)

Consider a PSA test and DRE in men with:
*   Any lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS):
    *   Nocturia
    *   Frequency
    *   Hesitancy
    *   Urgency
    *   Retention
*   Erectile dysfunction
*   Visible haematuria (also refer to [Haematuria (2WW)](visible-haematuria.html))

## Prereferral Investigations

### Essential
*   **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):** Mandatory for all referrals.
*   **PSA Test:**
    *   Ensure no active UTI (wait 1 month after treatment).
    *   Avoid if ejaculated in previous 48 hours.
    *   Avoid if vigorous exercise (e.g., cycling) in previous 48 hours.
    *   Avoid immediately after DRE (though DRE effect on PSA is minimal, best to draw before or wait a short period if concerned about borderline results).

### Optional / Helpful
*   **U&Es / eGFR:** To check renal function (important for MRI contrast).
*   **MSU:** To exclude infection if LUTS present.

## Exclusions / Caveats

*   **Asymptomatic Screening:** PSA screening in asymptomatic men is not a national policy. Men requesting PSA testing should be counselled on the benefits and risks (Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme).
*   **Incidental finding:** If an incidental elevated PSA is found in an asymptomatic man, repeat the test after 4-6 weeks to confirm (unless very high or abnormal DRE). *However, if the first result is significantly elevated or DRE is abnormal, do not delay 2WW referral.*

    *   Pelvic pain affecting daily activities.
    *   Pressure symptoms (e.g., urinary frequency, constipation).
*   Uncertain diagnosis or suspicion of malignancy.
*   Fibroids causing subfertility or recurrent pregnancy loss.
*   Large fibroids (>10 cm) or rapidly growing fibroids.

### Referral Pathway

1.  **Primary Care Management:**

    *   Include relevant history, examination findings, and investigation results in the referral.
3.  **Secondary Care Management:**

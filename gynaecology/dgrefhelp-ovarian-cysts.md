# Ovarian Cysts

## Overview
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop on a woman's ovary. They are quite common and often cause no symptoms. Most ovarian cysts are benign (non-cancerous) and resolve on their own within a few months. However, some cysts can cause problems if they rupture, bleed, or are very large.

## Symptoms
Many ovarian cysts cause no symptoms. However, if a cyst is large or causes problems, you may experience:
*   Pelvic pain – This may be a dull ache or a sharp pain.
*   Bloating or fullness in your abdomen
*   Pain during bowel movements
*   Pain during sexual intercourse
*   Nausea, vomiting, or breast tenderness – Similar to what you might feel during pregnancy
*   Heavy or irregular periods

## When to Seek Medical Advice
Seek prompt medical attention if you have:
*   Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain
*   Pain with fever or vomiting
*   Signs of shock, such as cold, clammy skin; rapid breathing; lightheadedness; or weakness

## Diagnosis
*   **Pelvic Exam:** Your doctor may be able to feel a cyst during a routine pelvic exam.
*   **Ultrasound:** This is the most common test used to diagnose ovarian cysts. It can help determine the size, shape, and location of the cyst.
*   **Laparoscopy:** A surgical procedure used to view the ovaries and remove cysts.
*   **CA-125 Blood Test:** This test measures the level of a protein called CA-125, which is often elevated in women with ovarian cancer. However, CA-125 levels can also be elevated in women with other conditions, such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease.

## Management
*   **Watchful Waiting:** In many cases, no treatment is needed. Your doctor may recommend repeat ultrasounds to monitor the cyst. Most functional cysts disappear within two or three menstrual cycles.
*   **Medication:** Hormonal birth control, such as birth control pills, may be prescribed to stop ovulation and prevent the development of new cysts. However, birth control pills won't shrink existing cysts.
*   **Surgery:** Surgery may be recommended if the cyst is large, doesn't go away, is causing symptoms, or is suspected to be cancerous. Surgery may involve:
    *   **Laparoscopy:** A minimally invasive procedure to remove the cyst through small incisions.
    *   **Laparotomy:** A more extensive surgery that involves making a larger incision in the abdomen.

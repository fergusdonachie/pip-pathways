# Fibroids DGRefHelp Pathway

## Definition

Fibroids are non-cancerous growths in the uterus. They are also known as leiomyomas or myomas. Fibroids are common, and many women have them at some point in their lives. They can vary in size, number, and location within the uterus.

## Symptoms

Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. However, some women may experience:

*   Heavy menstrual bleeding
*   Prolonged menstrual periods (lasting more than a week)
*   Pelvic pain or pressure
*   Frequent urination
*   Difficulty emptying the bladder
*   Constipation
*   Backache or leg pain

## Diagnosis

Fibroids are usually diagnosed during a routine pelvic exam. Your doctor may also order imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and location of the fibroids.

## Treatment

Treatment for fibroids depends on the severity of your symptoms, the size and location of the fibroids, and your desire to have children. Treatment options may include:

*   **Watchful waiting:** If you have mild symptoms, your doctor may recommend monitoring your condition without treatment.
*   **Medications:** Medications can help control heavy bleeding and pain.
*   **Surgery:** Surgical options include myomectomy (removal of fibroids) or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus).
*   **Uterine artery embolization (UAE):** This procedure blocks the blood supply to the fibroids, causing them to shrink.
*   **MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS):** This procedure uses high-intensity ultrasound waves to destroy fibroids.

## Referral Guidelines

Consider referral to gynaecology for:

*   Uncertain diagnosis
*   Severe or persistent symptoms despite medical management
*   Desire for surgical treatment
*   Fertility concerns

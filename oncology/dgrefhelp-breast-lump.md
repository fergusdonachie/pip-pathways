# DGRefHelp Breast Lump (2WW) Pathway

This page is a draft. Local agreement needed.

[ ] Check local referral forms (e.g. SCI Gateway, e-Referral) for specific criteria.
[ ] Confirm local age cut-offs (some areas use 35 instead of 30 for 2WW).

## Background
- **Breast cancer** is the most common cancer in the UK.
- **Most breast lumps are benign** (fibroadenoma, cyst, etc.), especially in younger women.
- **Pain alone** is rarely a symptom of breast cancer.

## Assessment
- **History**:
  - Duration of lump.
  - Change in size (related to menstrual cycle?).
  - Associated pain.
  - Nipple changes (discharge, inversion, rash).
  - Skin changes (tethering, peau d'orange, erythema).
  - Systemic symptoms (weight loss, bone pain).
  - Family history (breast/ovarian cancer).
- **Examination**:
  - Inspection (arms by side and raised): look for asymmetry, skin dimpling, nipple changes.
  - Palpation (all quadrants, tail of Spence, axilla, supraclavicular fossa).
  - Describe lump: size, consistency (hard/soft/cystic), mobility, fixation, irregular margins.

## Primary Care Management
- **Infection (Mastitis/Abscess)**:
  - If lactational: Flucloxacillin 500mg QDS (or Erythromycin/Clarithromycin if penicillin allergic). Encourage continued feeding/expressing.
  - If non-lactational: Co-amoxiclav 625mg TDS (cover anaerobes) or Metronidazole + Erythromycin.
  - **Refer urgently** if suspected abscess (fluctuant, pointing) or no response to antibiotics.
- **Breast Pain (Mastalgia)** without lump:
  - Reassurance (cancer risk low).
  - Well-fitting bra (measurements).
  - Topical NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen gel).
  - Consider evening primrose oil (evidence limited).
  - Keeping a pain diary.

## Who to refer
### Immediate / Same Day
- **Suspected Breast Abscess**: If pointing/fluctuant or septic (refer to General Surgery/Breast Unit depending on local pathway).
- **Infected cyst** or severe mastitis not responding to treatment.

### 2WW (Suspected Cancer)
- **Aged 30 and over** with an **unexplained breast lump** (with or without pain).
- **Aged 50 and over** with any of the following in **one nipple only**:
  - Discharge.
  - Retraction.
  - Other changes of concern.
- **Skin changes** suggesting breast cancer (e.g. peau d'orange, tethering).
- **Aged 30 and over** with an **unexplained lump in the axilla**.

### Routine Referral
- **Aged under 30** with an **unexplained breast lump** (with or without pain).
- **Severe/Persistent Mastalgia** failing primary care management (usually to Breast Clinic, not 2WW).
- **Nipple changes** not meeting 2WW criteria (e.g. bilateral, <50 years) but persistent.
- **Asymmetry** (new or changing) without lump.
- **Family History**: Refer to Family History Clinic / Genetics (check local criteria, usually via specific form).

## Who not to refer
- **Cyclical breast pain** alone with normal examination (manage in primary care).
- **Bilateral nipple discharge** (usually benign/physiological; check prolactin/medications).
- **Transient lumpiness** that resolves after menstruation (review in 4-6 weeks if unsure).

## Local agreement needed
- [ ] Confirm antibiotic choice for non-lactational mastitis (some guidelines suggest Co-amoxiclav, others Flucloxacillin + Metronidazole).
- [ ] Referral route for "Family History" (often separate from symptomatic breast clinic).
- [ ] Local age cut-off for 2WW vs Routine (NICE says 30, some areas use 35).

# Suspected Autism in Children

This guideline covers the recognition, referral, and primary care management of suspected autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and young people (under 19). It is based on NICE Clinical Guideline 128 (Recognition, referral and diagnosis) and CG170 (Management and support).

## Red Flags & Recognition

Consider the possibility of autism if there are concerns about development or behavior, particularly in the areas of social interaction and communication, or restricted/repetitive behaviors.

### General Indicators
-   **Parental/Carer Concern:** Always take parental concerns seriously, even if the child behaves differently in the clinical setting.
-   **Regression:** Any regression in language or social skills at any age is a significant red flag.

### Age-Specific Signs

**Preschool Children (Under 5 years)**
-   **Social Interaction:**
    -   Lack of social smile.
    -   Limited eye contact.
    -   Not following a point or checking back with parents (joint attention).
    -   Lack of interest in other children; prefers solitary play.
    -   Lack of pretend play.
-   **Communication:**
    -   Delayed speech or unusual use of language (e.g., echolalia, referring to self in third person).
    -   Little or no use of gestures (pointing, waving).
-   **Behaviors:**
    -   Repetitive movements (hand flapping, spinning).
    -   Strong adherence to routines; distress at minor changes.
    -   Unusual sensory interests (sniffing objects, staring at lights) or sensitivities (loud noises, textures).

**School-Aged Children (5-11 years)**
-   **Social:**
    -   Difficulty making or keeping friends.
    -   Difficulty understanding social rules or cues.
    -   Taking things literally; difficulty with sarcasm or idioms.
-   **Behavior/Interests:**
    -   Intense, highly focused interests in specific topics.
    -   Rigid thinking or preference for routine.
    -   "Meltdowns" or behavioral difficulties, especially in unstructured times or transitions.

**Adolescents**
-   Long-standing difficulties with social interaction or communication that may become more apparent as social demands increase.
-   Social isolation or preference for online interaction over face-to-face.
-   History of being bullied.

## Primary Care Management

1.  **History Taking:**
    -   Ask specifically about the "red flags" listed above.
    -   Ask about developmental history and milestones.
    -   Check for family history of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions.
    -   Use a structured tool if helpful (e.g., Q-CHAT for toddlers), but clinical judgment is paramount.

2.  **Examination:**
    -   Observe the child's behavior and interaction during the consultation.
    -   Rule out other causes (e.g., hearing test, vision check).
    -   Look for dysmorphic features or signs of other syndromes (e.g., tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis).

3.  **Support & Advice:**
    -   Validate the parents' concerns.
    -   Explain the referral process and manage expectations regarding waiting times.
    -   Provide information on local support groups or national resources (e.g., National Autistic Society).
    -   **School:** Advise parents to speak to the school SENCO (Special Educational Needs Coordinator). A medical diagnosis is not always required for school support to begin.

## Referral Criteria

**Referral is indicated if:**
-   There is regression in language or social skills (Refer immediately).
-   There are persistent concerns about autism based on the signs/red flags above.
-   The child has a sibling with autism (higher risk).

**Who to refer to:**
-   Refer to the **local Child Development Centre (CDC)**, **Community Paediatrics**, or **CAMHS** (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services), depending on the child's age and local pathway.
    -   *Typically:* Under 5s -> Community Paediatrics / CDC.
    -   *Typically:* School age -> CAMHS or specific neurodevelopmental pathway.

**Information to include in referral:**
-   Specific concerns regarding communication, social interaction, and behavior.
-   Developmental history.
-   Information from school or nursery (reports are very helpful).
-   Hearing test results (if available).
-   Family history.

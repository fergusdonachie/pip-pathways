## Primary care management

- Anterior knee pain is a common condition where pressure or pull on the patella from a variety of causes result in pain under the patella often radiating to the back of the knee.
- It can limit any movement where the patella has to track up and down the knee such as stairs, hills and squatting and kneeling
- It is best managed by strengthening and stretching the structures around the knee particularly the VMO muscle in the quadriceps in order to add support to the knee and reduce pain
- If the patella does sublux due to ligament instability this may need referral to specialist MSK services.



#### Management

- Core Strengthening Exercise recommended for 3-6 months found on NHS Inform
- Analgesia when required
- Weight management advice if applicable
- Can advise use of patella strap if pain impeding ability to work

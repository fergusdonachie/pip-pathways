## Introduction

Presentation

- Initial insidious onset of pain (See red Flag potential Charcot)
- Increased pain after long periods of standing or walking
- Previous trauma to the mid foot
- Dorsal deformity

## Symptoms/signs

- Pain/discomfort across midfoot
- Worse on standing or walking
- Certain shoes e.g. hard leather can make it painful
- Pain often worse after rest e.g. when rising from bed, before symptoms
- Worse after major injury to midfoot.
- A palpable bony prominence called an osteophyte usually forms over affected joints

## Differential diagnosis

- Charcot arthropathy
- Osteoarthritis
- fracture/dislocation/sublaxtion
- Gout
- Tarsal coalition

## Primary care management

**Evidence suggests that 80% of MSK problems are self limiting and will recover within 12-18months.** It is important to rule out serious pathology or any problem that warrants escalation but for all other cases a period of initial self directed rehabilitation should be given before any further intervention is considered.

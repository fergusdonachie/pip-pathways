## Introduction

- Suspected fracture
- Suspected unreduced shoulder dislocation
- Suspected septic arthritis  - Erythema, fever, systemically unwell

## Red flags

Serious Pathology as a cause of MSK conditions is rare

**Any Red Flag concerns need to be managed prior to MSK referral**

- Unexplained Mass/ previous Cancer
- Sudden onset of weakness
- Escalating pain- Progressive symptoms that doesn’t respond to conservative Rx
- Suspected inflammatory arthritis – *See Local Rheumatology Pathways *

## Rotator cuff injury

- Acute trauma / injury ( under 12 weeks)
- Loss of shoulder active movement , disabling pain/weakness
- Unable to sustain active movement against resistance

If < 60 years old urgent SCI referral to orthopaedics.

If >60 years old consider US and referral to physiotherapy

## Frozen shoulder

- Typically 40-60 years, more common in diabetic patients
- Capsular pattern- decreased abduction (hand out to side of body) , loss of hand behind back movement and hand behind head.
- Patient reports stiffness
- Likely a normal XR
- Previous trauma may indicate Glenohumeral OA on Xray

Primary Care Management: NSAIDs, refer Physiotherapy, steroid injection

**Consider referral to orthopaedics if worsening function/ reduced range, night pain, failed conservative management – X-rays can be ordered at same time**



## Acromio-clavicular pain

- Pain local over ACJ area/ overhead pain
- Usually > 30 years normally follows previous trauma
- More common in men
- Painful arc ( pain around 90 degrees of abduction)
- +ve cross arm test ( touch back of opposite shoulder)

Primary Care Management: NSAIDs, refer physiotherapy, steroid injection

**Consider referral to orthopaedics if failed conservative management and poor QOL – X-rays can be ordered at same time**

## Rotator cuff tendinopathy/subacromial bursitis

- More common 35-75 years
- Tends to follow repetitive movements/ low trauma fall
- Painful arc of pain ( into abduction) passive movement always full
- Pain on resisted abduction ( always exclude tear first)

Primary Care: NSAIDs, refer physiotherapy, steroid injection into sub-acromial space

**Consider referral to orthopaedics as end of line treatment if failed conservative management and poor QOL – US may be ordered at same time**

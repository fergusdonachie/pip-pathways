## Signs /Symptoms

- Characterised by Chords and Nodules in Palm / Fingers
- Flexion deformities typically at MCPJs and PIPJs
- Not usually painful
- Can slowly progress over months/years or have a rapid progression since onset

## Advice in Primary Care

- No evidence splintage or exercise arrests development of contracture
- Good practice to avoid gripping over prolonged periods – take regular breaks to stretch the hand and fingers

## Actions in Primary Care

- Direct Patient to NHS Inform Website for further info - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/
- Perform a Heustons Table Top Test i.e. lay hand palm down flat on table.
- IF Negative (flat hand - no gaps) – **No further action required**. Advise patient to monitor Table Top Test regularly.

## Referral to Secondary Care

- Positive Heustons Table Top Test i.e. unable to lay hand flat , gaps between palm/fingers and table (push a pencil through)
- Obvious flexion deformity at either MCPJ / PIPJ or both

Refer via SCI Gateway to **Occupational Therapy Hand Clinic** and include following in referral:

- Description of deformities i.e. flexion of MCPJs or PIPJs
- **ONLY** refer if patient wishes to pursue surgery (Do not wait until finger fully flexed to palm)
- Refer urgently if there is a soft tissue lump or swelling which is rapidly increasing in size, painful or has atypical features.
- Duration of symptoms

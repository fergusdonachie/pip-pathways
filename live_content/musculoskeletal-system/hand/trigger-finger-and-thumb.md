## Signs /Symptoms

- Nodule at level of A1 Pulley (over Palmar MCPJ) – palpate this area and ask patient to flex – nodule usually obvious.
- Patient may feel a “**CLICK**”
- Locking may be actively correctable i.e. patient can force straight again, or passively correctable whereby need to pull straight with other hand.
- Nodules may be painful especially if in contact with objects in the palm as when gripping

## Advice in Primary Care

- Spontaneous recovery may occur
- Try a finger splint as per information in advice sheet
- Avoid Prolonged flexion when gripping onto objects
- Try icing over nodule to reduce inflammation around tendon
- Activity modification – reduce repetitive tasks, take regular stretch breaks

## Actions in Primary Care

- Issue TRIGGER FINGER AND THUMB PATIENT LETTER* to patient and encourage to try a splint intermittently for 6 weeks
- Try steroid injection by appropriately trained Healthcare Practitioner if these skills are available in Surgery – if not refer to OT Hand clinic for injection (less successful in Diabetic Patients)
- Repeat only once if initial relief temporary
- Surgical release may be required if symptoms persist

## Referral to Secondary Care

- If symptoms persist following 6-8 weeks of self management
- No Active Flexion / Finger completely locked in flexion or unable to initiate active flexion

Refer via SCI Gateway to **Occupational Therapy Hand Clinic** and include following in referral:

- Duration of symptoms
- Duration of self management inc splint
- Precipitating factors i.e. injury/trauma, occupation

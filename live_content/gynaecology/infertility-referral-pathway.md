The need for referral to tertiary care for assisted conception will be determined following assessment at the secondary care level fertility clinic. When tertiary care assisted conception is required, the following criteria must be met:

- Age - female partner aged less than 39 years at time of referral
- Sterilisation - neither partner should have been previously sterilised
- BMI for female partner should be above 18.5 and below 30
- Smoking - both partners should be non-smokers and nicotine free
- Both partners should abstain from illegal substances and be methadone free for at least one year
- Previous children – couples where one partner has no living biological child can access treatment if all other access criteria are met in full
- Couple co-habiting in stable relationship for at least 2 years
- Number of cycles - eligible couples referred to tertiary centre may have up to 3 cycles

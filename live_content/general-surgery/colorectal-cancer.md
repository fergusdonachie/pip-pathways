## Overview


> **WARNING:** Warning


### qFIT testing

- qFIT tests for occult blood in the stool. It uses antibodies to human haemoglobin so avoids the false positives of the old FOB tests.
- it is a quantitative test and the risk of significant finding on scope does increase with level

qFIT < 10μgHb/g and normal FBC - 0.1% risk colorectal cancer
- qFIT 10-19μgHb/g and iron deficient anaemia - 1.1% risk of colorectal cancer
- qFIT 10 - 400 - 20% chance significant finding
- qFIT > 400 - >50% chance of significant finding >20% colorectal cancer

- the risk of bowel cancer in someone with qFIT<10, normal FBC and normal examination is <0.1%
- this is lower than the population risk

## Assessment

Assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer should include:

- Digital rectal examination - it is important to identify a potentially obstructing low rectal tumour so they are seen in clinic rather than direct to colonoscopy
- Abdominal examination
- FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT
- qFIT
- Note qFIT not required for referral of palpable anorectal or abdominal mass or unexplained anorectal ulceration but still helpful to send
- Do not request CEA or faecal calprotectin

Do not arrange qFIT for patients without symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer above

## Repeat qFIT

For patients with iron deficient anaemia or ongoing symptoms with qFIT < 20μgHb/g

- Repeat qFIT at 4 weeks
- If repeat qFIT ≥ 20μgHb/g refer USoC as below
- If repeat qFIT < 20μgHb/g refer on general colorectal pathway below

## Who to refer

There are three referral pathways for patients with suspicion of colorectal cancer:

 

 

 

## Who not to refer

Patients under 40 with low risk symptoms and qFIT < 10μgHb/g

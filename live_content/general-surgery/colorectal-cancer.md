## Introduction


### qFIT testing

- qFIT tests for occult blood in the stool. It uses antibodies to human haemoglobin so avoids the false positives of the old FOB tests.
- it is a quantitative test and the risk of significant finding on scope does increase with level

qFIT < 10μgHb/g and normal FBC - 0.1% risk colorectal cancer
- qFIT 10-19μgHb/g and iron deficient anaemia - 1.1% risk of colorectal cancer
- qFIT 10 - 400 - 20% chance significant finding
- qFIT > 400 - >50% chance of significant finding >20% colorectal cancer

- the risk of bowel cancer in someone with qFIT<10, normal FBC and normal examination is <0.1%
- this is lower than the population risk

## Assessment


### Symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer

- Abdominal mass
- Palpable ano-rectal mass or unexplained anorectal ulceration
- Persistent (more than four weeks) change in bowel habit especially to looser stools - not simple constipation
- Abdominal pain (4 weeks) with weight loss (5%) (also consider upper GI cancer)
- Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (Hb low and ferritin <30mg/L)
- Repeated ano-rectal bleeding without obvious anorectal cause
- Any blood mixed with stool

Assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer should include:

- Digital rectal examination - it is important to identify a potentially obstructing low rectal tumour so they are seen in clinic rather than direct to colonoscopy
- Abdominal examination
- FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT
- qFIT
- Note qFIT not required for referral of palpable anorectal or abdominal mass or unexplained anorectal ulceration but still helpful to send
- Do not request CEA or faecal calprotectin

Do not arrange qFIT for patients without symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer above

## Repeat qFIT

For patients with iron deficient anaemia or ongoing symptoms with qFIT < 20μgHb/g

- Repeat qFIT at 4 weeks
- If repeat qFIT ≥ 20μgHb/g refer USoC as below
- If repeat qFIT < 20μgHb/g refer on general colorectal pathway below

## Who to refer

There are three referral pathways for patients with suspicion of colorectal cancer:


### Direct to test colorectal pathway

This is a direct to test pathway for patients meeting the criteria below. Aim is for referral to test within 10 days.


#### Mandatory tests

- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam
- Note qFIT is not required prior to referral in patients with palpable abdominal or rectal mass but is still useful to send. You can enter 0 in mandatory qFIT field


#### Indication

- qFIT > 20 μg Hb/g and symptoms/signs as above
- Age under 75 years
- Fit/suitable for outpatient bowel prep


#### Exclusions

- Patients on anticoagulants - i.e. warfarin/DOAC
- Colonoscopy or CT colon performed in past 12 months
- Declined or unable to complete a qFIT prior to referral
- Frail patients


#### Priority options - Urgent suspicion of cancer(USOC) only


#### Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG USOC Colorectal


#### Choose Direct to Colonoscopy from dropdown option

 


### Clinic review colorectal pathway

This is a fast track pathway with escalated clinic review and diagnostic test. Aiming for referral to test within 15 days


#### Mandatory tests

- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam
- If there is a clinical reason why DRE/qFIT cannot be completed, document this in the referral
- qFIT is not required prior to referral in patients with abdominal or rectal mass but still send one if possible


#### Indication

- qFIT > 20μgHb/g and symptoms/signs as above
- Not suitable for the direct to test pathway, e.g. due to age >75
- Patients with qFIT < 20μgHb/g but with iron deficient anaemia and meet criteria for USOC referral.


#### Exclusions

- Patients who decline qFIT


#### Priority options - Urgent suspicion of cancer(USOC) only


#### Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG USOC Colorectal

 


### General colorectal pathway


#### Mandatory tests

- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam. Consider second qFIT


#### Indication

- qFIT < 20μgHb/g and symptoms/signs as above and significant clinical concern - **Refer Urgent**
- Patients with symptoms requiring secondary care management but without significant clinical concern - **R****efer Routine**


#### Exclusions

- None


#### Priority options - Urgent/Routine/Advice


#### Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG Colorectal

 

## Who not to refer

Patients under 40 with low risk symptoms and qFIT < 10μgHb/g

## Overview


> **WARNING:** Warning

Upper GI cancers (oesophagus, stomach, hepato-pancreato-biliary) often present with vague symptoms which are very common in non-cancer presentations in primary care. Identifying those patients to refer is therefore difficult based on individual 'red flag' symptoms. 

Dysphagia for gastro-oesophageal cancer and jaundice for pancreatic cancer are the only discriminatory symptoms (i.e. >3% positive predictive value)

Common symptoms are:

- Dysphagia
- Dyspepsia/reflux
- Nausea/vomiting
- Upper abdominal pain
- Early satiety
- Abdominal mass
- Unintentional weight loss
- Jaundice
- Change in bowel habit
- New onset diabetes at an older age

Note that iron deficiency anaemia is not one of the criteria for USoC referral for upper GI - see Colorectal cancer pathway.

Where there is a strong 'gut feeling' of malignancy but the patient does not fit the site specific criteria a referral to the Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Service may be appropriate.

## Assessment

Assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of upper GI cancer should include:

- Abdominal examination
- FBC to assess for anaemia
- U&E, LFT
- HbA1c

## Refer urgent suspicion of cancer

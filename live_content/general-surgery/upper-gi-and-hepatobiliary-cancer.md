## Overview

Upper GI cancers (oesophagus, stomach, hepato-pancreato-biliary) often present with vague symptoms which are very common in non-cancer presentations in primary care. Identifying those patients to refer is therefore difficult based on individual 'red flag' symptoms.

Dysphagia for gastro-oesophageal cancer and jaundice for pancreatic cancer are the only discriminatory symptoms (i.e. >3% positive predictive value)

Common symptoms are:

- Dysphagia
- Dyspepsia/reflux
- Nausea/vomiting
- Upper abdominal pain
- Early satiety
- Abdominal mass
- Unintentional weight loss
- Jaundice
- Change in bowel habit
- New onset diabetes at an older age

Note that iron deficiency anaemia is not one of the criteria for USoC referral for upper GI - see Colorectal cancer pathway.

Where there is a strong 'gut feeling' of malignancy but the patient does not fit the site specific criteria a referral to the Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Service may be appropriate.

## Assessment

Assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of upper GI cancer should include:

- Abdominal examination
- FBC to assess for anaemia
- U&E, LFT
- HbA1c

## Refer urgent suspicion of cancer

#### Oesophago-gastric cancer

- Persistent or progressive dysphagia (**NOT**a 'feeling of something stuck in throat')
- Weight loss (5% or more of bodyweight or strong clinical suspicion)**AND**age 55 or over**AND**one of:
    - upper abdominal pain
    - early satiety
    - reflux
    - dyspepsia
    - nausea and/or vomiting

#### Hepato-pancreato-biliary cancer

- Painless obstructive jaundice in a person aged 40 years or over
- Weight loss (5% or more of bodyweight or strong clinical suspicion)**AND**age 55 or over**AND**one of:
    - change in bowel habit
    - back and/or abdominal pain
    - nausea and/or vomiting
    - new onset diabetes
- Abdominal pain in a person 55 or over with any of:
    - nausea and/or vomiting
    - weight loss (5% or more of bodyweight or strong clinical suspicion)

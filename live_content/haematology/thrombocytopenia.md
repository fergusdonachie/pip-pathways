Fetched: 2026-02-23

## Introduction

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 140 (normal lab ref range 140 – 400).

Individuals with platelet count of >50 are generally asymptomatic. The risk of spontaneous / significant bleeding increases when platelet count falls below 20X109/L.

Bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia is usually muco-cutaneous; bruising / petechiae, GI or GU bleeding. The risk of intra-cranial bleeding is relatively low except in the presence of another risk factor (A/V malformation, uncontrolled hypertension, anticoagulation therapy)

Potential causes

- Chronic liver disease / Cirrhosis, Portal Hypertension
- Alcohol, drugs (Quinine, Bendroflumethazide, Sulpha drugs, NSAIDs, Phenytoin, Methotrexate, H2 Blockers, Heparin)
- Acute Sepsis
- HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B
- Immune Thrombocytopenia – isolated or associated with haemolytic anaemia
- Bone Marrow Failure
- Consumptive Coagulopathy (DIC, TTP, HUS)
- Spurious thrombocytopenia (clotted sample, incomplete EDTA anticoagulation)

 

## Assessment

- History and examination for signs of an underlying systemic disorder, drug & alcohol
- Repeat FBC, lab will add on blood film examination if appropriate
- Liver and renal function test
- Haematinics
- Viral Serology -  HIV, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B
- Consider auto-immune screen – guided by history findings

## Primary care management

- Repeat FBC in 4 weeks in case of mild thrombocytopenia particularly if a potential cause has been identified and discontinued / reversed

## Who to refer


### Urgent referral to haematology

- Isolated platelet count of <50
- Platelet count of 50 – 100 with:
- Concomitant cytopenia (Haemoglobin <100, Neutrophils <1.0), abnormal film
- Splenomegaly, Lymphadenopathy
- Patient due for planned surgery
- In pregnancy

***Patients presenting with platelet count <20 or excess bruising / bleeding – regardless of the platelet count – should be discussed with the on-call haematologist***


### Routine referral or advice request

- Moderate persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count 50 – 100 in at least 2 consecutive blood count) in the absence of a clear cause
- Thrombocytopenia and history of thrombosis

## Who not to refer

Cases with isolated stable mild thrombocytopenia ( platelet count of 100 – 140) do not need to be referred. Please discuss these cases with haematology team via advice request.

## Introduction

Normal neutrophil count is 2.0 – 7.5X109/L

Neutropenia is classified as:

- Mild neutropenia 1.0 – 1.8
- Moderate neutropenia 0.5 – 1.0
- Severe neutropenia < 0.5

Causes include:

- Drugs:

antipsychotic drugs
- carbimazole
- sulpha drugs
- NSAIDs
- bendroflumethiazide
- anticonvulsant
- H2 Blockers

## Assessment

- Careful history and clinical examination for evidence of recurrent infection, medication causes, organomegaly.
- Repeat FBC and request blood film
- Auto-immune screen
- Viral serology for HIV
- Haematinics

## Primary care management

Cases with mild asymptomatic neutropenia is not an indication for referral – chronic idiopathic neutropenia.

In cases of mild neutropenia, recommend annual FBC monitoring. Referral is indicated when neutrophil count falls to less <1.0

## Who to refer

### Immediate referral for admission

Patients with severe neutropenia with evidence of sepsis require admission via Combined Assessment Unit

### Urgent referral

- Neutropenia with concomitant cytopenia
- Neutropenia in the presence of adenopathy or splenomegaly

### Routine referral

- Moderate neutropenia; persistent neutrophils of <1.0
- Neutropenia in association with recurrent infection or other abnormal findings

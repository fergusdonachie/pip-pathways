## Introduction

Polycythaemia is characterised by

- elevated haemoglobin > 180g/L (males), > 165 (females) and/or
- rise in Haematocrit > 0.52  (males), >0.45 (females).

Causes

- Primary: Myeloproliferative Neoplasia – Primary Polycythaemia
- Secondary (true): hypoxaemia (cyanotic heart disease, chronic lung disease, OSA), Erythropoietin-secreting tumours / renal cyst
- Relative Polycythaemia resulting from reduced plasma volume - diuresis

## Assessment

Assess

- Alcohol/smoking
- History suggestive of sleep apnoea (although this is a rare cause of polycythaemia)
- Illicit drug/food supplements
- For signs chronic lung disease including O2 sats
- Examine for splenomegaly

Investigations

- Repeat FBC ensuring good hydration

## Primary care management

Advise about lifestyle factors.

Individuals with mild idiopathic erythrocytosis who do not require venesection / intervention and show stable red cell indices can be followed up in primary care with a blood count check every 6-12 months (individual monitoring plan).

Discuss referral to haematology if there is steady rise in red cell indices or suspicious symptoms

## Who to refer


### Urgent referral

- Very high Haematocrit; > 0.6 in males, > 0.56 in females
- Raised Haematocrit in association with acute arterial or venous thrombotic event or active neurological symptoms (persistent headache, visual impairment, TIA)


### Routine referral or advice request

- Relatively raised Haematocrit in association with; splenomegaly, unexplained pruritis
- Concomitant unexplained increase in white cell count of platelet count
- Persistent unexplained rise in Haematocrit; > 0.52 in males, > 0.46 in females

## Introduction


### Testing in asymptomatic patients

There is no screening programme but it is reasonable to carry out PSA in patients who request testing in the following groups:

- Age 50 and over
- Age 45 and over with risk factor

First degree relative with prostate cancer (brother/father)
- Black or mixed black ethnicity
- Carry a BRCA gene variant

Leaflets to support this are available on Prostate Cancer Risk Management site


### PSA testing in elderly

PSA testing in men age 80 and over should be avoided unless there are symptoms suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer.

## Assessment

Patient presents with urinary symptoms or has requested PSA testing.

Consider:

- Lower urinary tract symptoms
- Infective symptoms - exclude UTI before testing PSA
- Family history of prostate/ovarian/breast cancer
- Bone pain

Before having a PSA test men should not have:

- an active UTI (PSA may remain raised for many weeks) - large effect
- ejaculated in the previous 48 hours - small effect < 1 mcg/l
- exercised vigorously in the previous 48 hours - moderate effect 50-90% rise
- had a prostate biopsy in the previous 6 weeks - large effect
- had a DRE in the previous 24 hours - very small effect <0.25mcg/l

If a raised PSA result is received in the context of a suspected or proven UTI repeat after 6 weeks

## Who to refer

**Refer fast track prostate pathway**

- PSA > 10 

Mandatory tests:

- Rectal examination
- U&E
- MRI Checklist:

Presence of shunts/pumps/heart valves
- Orbital foreign body/shrapnel
- Cranial surgery/aneurysm clips
- Claustrophobia
- Cochlear implant
- Pacemaker

Exclusion criteria:

- Age ≥ 80
- Unfit for active treatment
- Patients unable to attend appointments Monday AM
- Patients who decline/are not able to have DRE

These patients can be referred via the existing urology referral pathway

Refer via SCI-Gateway Urology...Fast track prostate referral

Symptoms or signs of Cauda Equina Syndrome need emergency discussion with on-call team

**Refer urgent suspected cancer**

For patients in whom fast track referral not indicated.

Refer immediately:

- Under 70: PSA ≥ 3 ng/ml
- 70-79: PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml
- 80 and above: PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml (or ≥ 7.5ng/ml with features suggestive of metastatic disease)

Refer via SCI-Gateway...Urology...Urological

Symptoms or signs of Cauda Equina Syndrome need emergency discussion with on-call team

**Age-specific PSA ranges**

- Under 70 years < 3.0
- Age 70-79 < 5.0

In older men consider realistic medicine principles. Routine or no referral may be appropriate.

- Age 80 and over ≥ 20.0

## Who not to refer

- Raised PSA in context of infection (repeat in 4 weeks and refer if still raised)
- If downward trend could be repeated again after 4 weeks
- Frail elderly in whom a diagnosis of prostate cancer would not affect their management

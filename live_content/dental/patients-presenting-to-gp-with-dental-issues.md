## Introduction

Dental problems do not fall within the remit of GP practice, however, due to the national shortage of NHS dentists, patients may present to practices with dental problems.

## Patients who have a dentist

If patients are already registered with a dentist they should be directed there for routine or urgent dental issues.

## Patients who are not registered with a dentist


### Routine dental care

Patients can contact the dental helpline 01387 245532 or visit  https://dghscp.co.uk/dental-services/ for up to date information on availablity of NHS dentists, however, they are likely to need to register with a private dentist.


#### Student clinic

There are some dental students placed in D&G so this may be an option for some patients. They can contact ***dg.dentalhelpline@nhs.scot***or the helpline number to note interest in being treated by a student. This does not incur any patient charges. It is only available to adults (over 16)


### Urgent dental issue

Patients who do not have a dentist and develop an urgent dental issue - severe pain/swelling, may be able to access the emergency dental service. They should call 01387 245532 in hours and 111 out of hours. This service provides only immediately necessary treatment and will be triaged. Standard NHS dental charges will apply.

Prescribing antibiotics should be avoided in patients presenting to GPs.

## Special care dental service

The Special Care dental service is the NHS dental clinic that provides dental care for those who by virtue of disability, vulnerability or medical conditions could not access a standard dentist (General Dental Service - GDS), either for all or some of their dental care.

It does not provide care for patients who could attend a high street dentist if one was available.

The service is for:

- Assessment and treatment of patients with additional care needs where patients cannot be managed in GDS-

physical disabilities who require the use of mechanical aids not available in GDS
- learning disabilities
- mental health problems
- significant medical compromise
- frail older patients

Historically patients would have been referred to this service by their usual dentist, however, they can also be referred by a GP via SCI-Gateway...D&G Dental Services...Public Dental Service...DG-HD Public Dental Service

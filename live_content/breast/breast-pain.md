## Introduction

Breast pain is common and rarely associated with breast cancer.

Two main patterns are seen:

Non-cyclical usually arises from the chest wall and palpation of the chest wall behind the breast in the sitting position or with the patient on their side, will elicit tenderness while compression of the breast tissue alone is not particularly uncomfortable.

Lifestyle issues for cyclical pain—supportive bra, low fat diet and reduced caffeine.

For non-cyclical pain—supportive bra, attention to provoking activity using the arm on the affected side and other musculoskeletal issues, eg neck pain.

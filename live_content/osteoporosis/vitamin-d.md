## Introduction

#### Background

- Vitamin D deficiency is common in Scotland.
- Most people are asymptomatic.
- Osteomalacia is rare.
- Measurement of vitamin D is relatively expensive - £6.70 in D & G, Sept 2018



#### When to measure serum vitamin D

- Pretreatment for osteoporosis
- Incident low trauma fracture
- eGFR < 30 if calcium low or PTH high
- Malabsorption syndromes
- Chronic liver disease
- Severe anorexia nervosa
- Confirmed hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium <2.10 nmol/l) on two consecutive measurements
- Drug treatments that increase risk of deficiency or where deficiency requires treatment prior to initiation
- Note. For at risk groups (eg. Pregnancy, breast feeding, poor sun exposure) measurement is not required. Recommend low dose supplements such as

Healthy start vitamins 400 i.u. per day
- Valupak D3 1000 i.u. per day

## How to interpret serum vitamin D (25 OHD) levels

Serum vitamin D levels are classified as:

- < 25 nmol/l = deficient
- 25-50 nmol/l = insufficient
- > 50 nmol/l = adequate

There is marked seasonal variation with lowest levels in winter and spring.

In winter and spring:

- 92% of the Scottish population have a vitamin D level less that 75 nmol/l and
- 24% have a level below 25 nmol/l.

This rises to 75% and 8% in the summer and autumn.



## Treatment

Only treat deficient levels. Over the counter supplements are recommended for all in the winter and spring.

#### Vitamin D treatment

##### Loading Dose

- **Stexerol D3** 2x25,000 i.u. tablets weekly for 6 weeks
- Or if swallowing difficulty, **Invita D3** 2x 25,000 i.u. vials oral drops weekly for 6 weeks

##### Maintenance

- **Stexerol D3** 1000 i.u. per day or 25,000 i.u. per month indefinitely
- Or if swallowing difficulty **Invita D3** 25,000 i.u. vials 1 per month indefinitely

## Treatment in patients receiving osteoporosis treatment

### When to check vitamin D levels

- All patients beginning osteoporosis treatment should have vitamin D checked at baseline unless decision to give loading dose vitamin D in any case.
- If already receiving treatment for osteoporosis +/- calcium and vitamin D supplements measurement only required**if new fracture or hypocalcaemia.**

### How to treat deficiency

#### Loading dose course

- Given as above ideally prior to commencing treatment such as bisphosphonates
- If already receiving calcium and vitamin D supplements these must be stopped during loading course (6 weeks)
- Repeat vitamin D level not required following loading course

#### Maintenance following loading dose course

- For those whose diet is low in calcium or absorption likely to be poor recommend calcium and vitamin D - **Adcal D3** *2 caplets twice daily* or **Theical D3** *once daily.*Consider in:

age over 70
- frail
- housebound

## Further notes

#### Chronic kidney disease

Treatment is generally as above but for patients with eGFR < 30 with secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal may suggest **Alfacalcidol** instead.



#### Drug treatments that may cause or exacerbate deficiency

- Anti-convulsants, Corticosteroids. Cholestyramine, HAART, Rifampicin.
- Parenteral treatments for osteoporosis – recheck vitamin D prior to each IV Zoledronic acid and once a year if on Denosumab and compliance of supplements uncertain



#### Intramuscular vitamin D

For those with deficiency unable to take oral supplements (eg severe malabsorption or liver disease) recommend **Ergocalciferol** 300.000 units intramuscularly every 6 months.

Because of potentially exorbitant costs and short shelf life ideally this is given in OPD. If given in primary care obtain from hospital pharmacy by request on headed note paper.



#### When to repeat vitamin D measurement

Not required on treatment unless specific circumstances (eg malabsorption, suspected poor compliance, new low trauma fracture, drug treatments that may cause deficiency). Levels plateau slowly - repeat testing in < 6 months after starting treatment **never** indicated.

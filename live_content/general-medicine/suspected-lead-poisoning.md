Fetched: 2026-02-23

## Introduction

- Lead exposure is usually chronic and may be asymptomatic; there is no known safe blood lead concentration in children.
- Main treatment is **identify and remove the exposure source**

paint dust/renovation
- imported cosmetics/spices/remedies
- water/pipework
- occupational/hobby exposure

## Assessment

- **Who to suspect / when to test**

**Children (especially 1–4 years):** pica or marked hand-to-mouth behaviour; neurodevelopmental disorders; unexplained abdominal pain or constipation; headache; irritability; anaemia; faltering growth.
- **Pregnant women:** any possible environmental or occupational exposure (e.g. paint stripping, renovation, imported products).
- **Adults:** compatible symptoms (abdominal pain, constipation, neuropathy, fatigue, cognitive symptoms) or known occupational/hobby exposure.

- Pre-1970 housing; recent renovation, sanding or heat stripping of paint.
- Peeling paint or contaminated soil.
- Imported spices, cosmetics or remedies (e.g. kohl/surma).
- Glazed ceramics or cookware.
- Shooting ranges; fishing weights.
- Battery manufacture/recycling; metal work; stained glass.
- “Take-home” exposure via contaminated clothing.

- **Whole blood lead concentration** (EDTA tube).
- **FBC** (look for anaemia).
- Consider **iron studies** (iron deficiency increases lead absorption).
- U&E / LFT if clinically indicated.
- If accidental ingestion of a lead-containing object suspected: consider abdominal X-ray.

## Primary care management

- Identify and remove/abate the source of exposure.
- Consider vulnerable household contacts (especially children/pregnancy).
- Check and correct iron and/or calcium deficiency if present.
- Contact **NPIS** if unsure about monitoring or exposure avoidance.

- No routine repeat required if exposure removed.
- Repeat only if further suspected exposure.

- Repeat blood Pb**4 weeks** after removal from exposure.
- Monitor every 1–3 months until below 0.1 µmol/L.
- Contact **NPIS** for advice on monitoring frequency if exposure risk persists.
- If level rises to ≥0.24 µmol/L, follow next section.

- **Contact local Health Protection Team (HPT)** for source identification and abatement advice.
- Remove from exposure where possible.

- Notify **Health Protection Team**
- Repeat blood Pb **2–4 weeks after removal from exposure.**
- Then repeat **2–12 weekly** until <0.1 µmol/L (2 µg/dL), depending on clinical context and re-exposure risk.

- Notify **Health Protection Team** if ≥ 0.48 µmol/L (10 µg/dL).
- Assess for symptoms.
- Repeat blood Pb **2–4 weeks after removal from exposure**.
- If falling, repeat 1–6 monthly until <0.24 µmol/L, then 6–12 monthly until <0.1 µmol/L.

- **Discuss urgently with NPIS**.
- Consider hospital admission and possible chelation (specialist decision).
- Notify **Health Protection Team**

- Re-review exposure sources and ensure effective removal/abatement.
- Involve local **HPT**.
- If level rises to ≥2.2 µmol/L (45 µg/dL), treat as urgent and escalate.

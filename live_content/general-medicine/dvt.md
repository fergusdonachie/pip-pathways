## Introduction

Protocol for investigation and management of possible DVT

Discuss with on-call physician if:

- Acutely unwell
- Suspected PE

Discuss with on-call obstetrician if patient pregnant



## Primary care assessment

Complete pre-test probability using Wells score below or online calculator

#### Criterion

#### Score

DVT is ***likely*** if the score is 2 or more

DVT is ***unlikely*** if the score is 0 or 1

## DVT unlikely - Well's score 0 or 1

###### Check D-Dimer

###### D-Dimer positive

- Refer for urgent USS leg via SCI Gateway. Ensure D-dimer and Well's score is included in clinical details.
- Start Apixaban 10mg BD for 7 days then 5mg BD unless contra-indication.
- Take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, Clotting but no need to await results before starting Apixaban.

###### D-Dimer negative

- DVT excluded
- Consider alternative diagnosis

## DVT likely - Well's score 2 or more

- Do D-dimer but negative result does not rule out DVT in this group so also
- Refer for urgent USS leg via SCI Gateway. Ensure Well's score is included in clinical details.
- Start Apixaban 10mg BD for 7 days then 5mg BD unless contra-indication.
- Take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, Clotting but no need to await results before starting Apixaban.

## Scan negative

- Stop any anticoagulation that had been started
- Advise patient on signs DVT
- If D-dimer was positive, reassess in 7 days
- Consider repeat USS if ongoing or worsening signs

## Scan positive

Start Apixaban 10mg bd for a week then 5mg BD for 3 months.

Advise patients they should use grade 2 compression stockings lifelong.

For patients with significant ongoing swelling routine referral to vascular for review is reasonable.

If patient has active cancer, liaise with their cancer team about treatment as this can vary depending on the type of cancer. 6 months treatment may be recommended.

Consider causes for unprovoked DVT:

- 10% of patients with unprovoked DVT will have malignancy
- Consider underlying malignancy if D-dimer very high (>4000)
- May be presenting sign of prostate or pancreatic cancer
- Review patient for physical examination
- Review baseline bloods and symptoms
- No indication for further investigations for cancer if no relevant symptoms or signs elicited

#### Ilio-femoral DVT

This may be suitable for thrombolysis or clot retrieval, particularly in otherwise well people ('good functional status, life expectancy of one year or more and low risk of bleeding' - NICE 2020).

It needs to be done within 14 days of symptom onset. If scan shows common femoral/iliac vein clot (or inferior vena cava or subclavian DVT and they have severe symptoms:

- Severe pain, especially groin and calf pain
- Severe swelling and tenderness
- Inability to weight bear/use limb/walk
- Any concern about venous ischaemia/compartment syndrome
- Concerning imaging features (e.g. hanging IVC clot)

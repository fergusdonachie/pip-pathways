## Introduction

- Alcohol misuse is a major health issue in Scotland, with high rates of hospital admissions and mortality.
- Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) occurs after abrupt cessation or reduction in heavy, prolonged drinking.
- Symptoms usually begin within 6–8 hours, peak at 10–30 hours, and last 3–7 days.
- Features include tremor, sweating, insomnia, agitation, nausea, and autonomic disturbance.
- Severe cases may develop seizures or delirium tremens (DTs), which can be fatal if untreated.
- Wernicke’s encephalopathy is a medical emergency: confusion, ataxia, and eye signs may be present, but many cases do not show the full triad. If suspected please refer to the emergency department as IV thiamine may be required

## Assessment

- Ask about alcohol intake (units per day, units per week, pattern of drinking and how long for).
- FAST screening tool (validated by NICE) is recommended: see below

FBC, U&E, LFTs including GGT and AST

## Primary care management

- Prescribe Thiamine 50mg TDS until the patient has been abstinent for 6 months and have resumed a balanced diet
- Advise reduce alcohol slowly but not to stop (explain risks of sudden cessation)
- Do not prescribe benzodiazepines in primary care due to risk of drinking on top. If a detox is required, refer to SDAS.
- Signpost to local support i.e. With You / ADS if a detox is not required.
- Fast score: 3-8. Nalmefene is a licensed treatment option which can be considered by GPs to support reduction of hazardous drinking.

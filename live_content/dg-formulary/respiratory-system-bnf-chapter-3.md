## 1. Airways disease, obstructive

See NHS D&G Quit Your Way for smoking cessation

### National pathways and resources

- Asthma pathway (BTS, NICE, SIGN)
- NICE Guideline NG115 - COPD in over 16s Dec 2018
- Quality prescribing strategy for respiratory conditions - Scottish Government

### Inhaler Devices

- The choice of device should be based on patient factors eg manual dexterity, inhaler technique. Where possible the most cost effective and sustainable device should be prescribed..
- Combination inhalers are preferred over individual components to aid compliance.
- Always check inhaler technique and compliance before switching therapy.
- Patients with a metered dose inhaler (MDI) should have a spacer available for use for all occasions, but particularly for acute exacerbations.
- Consider using lower carbon footprint (CF) inhalers where clinically appropriate. You may wish to use the NICE decision aid , which considers the carbon footprint of inhalers as well as other issues affecting inhaler selection.

### Bronchodilators

#### SABA – Short Acting Beta2 Agonists

Do not prescribe alone or as first-line in asthma. Ensure a preventer (ICS or ICS/LABA as MART) is also prescribed. For new patients, consider low dose ICS/formoterol (AIR) or MART.

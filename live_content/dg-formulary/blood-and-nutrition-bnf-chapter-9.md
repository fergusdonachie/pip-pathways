- Folic acid 5mg tablets

- Hydroxocobalamin injection for the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency (see CKS)

For people with neurological involvement seek urgent specialist advice from a haematologist who will advise on treatment frequency.

For people with no neurological involvement

- Initially administer hydroxocobalamin 1 mg intramuscularly three times a week for 2 weeks.
- The maintenance dose depends on whether the deficiency is diet related or not. For people with B12 deficiency that is:

Not thought to be diet related — administer hydroxocobalamin 1 mg intramuscularly every 2–3 months for life.
- Thought to be diet related — consider oral cyanocobalamin tablets prescribing guidance under review
- In vegans, treatment may need to be life-long, whereas in other people with dietary deficiency replacement treatment can be stopped once the vitamin B12 levels have been corrected and the diet has improved.

- Eggs.
- Foods which have been fortified with vitamin B12 (for example some soy products, and some breakfast cereals and breads) are good alternative sources to meat, eggs, and dairy products.
- Meat.

- Short bowel syndrome.
- Intractable malabsorption.

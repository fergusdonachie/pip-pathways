### Advice on switching between different manufacturers' products

The MHRA have divided anti-epileptic drugs into 3 categories in order to determine whether it is necessary to maintain continuity of the same brand.

Category 1 – Ensure that the patient is maintained on a specific manufacturer’s product:

- carbamazepine,
- phenobarbital,
- phenytoin,
- primidone

Category 2 - Base the need for continued supply of a particular manufacturer’s product on clinical judgement and consultation with patient and/or carer, taking into account factors such as seizure frequency and treatment history. Take into account patient/carer-related factors such as their negative perceptions about alternative products and/or other issues related to the patient should also be taken into account:

- clobazam,
- clonazepam,
- eslicarbazepine,
- lamotrigine,
- oxcarbazepine,
- perampanel,
- retigabine,
- rufinamide,
- topiramate,
- valproate,
- zonisamide

Category 3 – The potential for clinically relevant differences to exist between different manufacturers’ products is considered to be extremely low. However, consider other patient/carer-related factors, such as negative perceptions about alternative products and/or other issues related to the patient (e.g. patient anxiety, risk of confusion or dosing errors):

- brivaracetam,
- ethosuximide,
- gabapentin,
- lacosamide,
- levetiracetam,
- pregabalin,
- tiagabine,
- vigabatrin

This guidance only relates to the treatment of epilepsy – it does not apply to the use of these drugs for other indications eg neuropathic pain.

## 3. Mental health disorders

To know more about mental health conditions and their treatment, and to obtain printable patient information leaflets go to: www.choiceandmedication.org/nhs24/


### Acute anxiety state

- Diazepam tablets 2mg ✓ First Choice - short term treatment only of acute crises (ensure appropriate review)


### Treatment of anxiety and related disorders

- First line – Individualised self help (CBT based) / Psychoeducation
- Second line – High intensity psychological intervention / CBT etc

For adults whose anxiety disorder symptoms only partially respond to psychological interventions consider adding medication:

Benzodiazepines are associated with poorer outcomes in the long term and should not be prescribed for the treatment of anxiety except as a short-term measure during crises.


#### Pharmacological treatment of anxiety

(Note: different antidepressants have differing product licenses for the anxiety disorders, see product literature for details)

- Sertraline ✓ First Choice
- Fluoxetine in OCD / BDD ✓ First Choice; tends to require higher doses than depression
- Alternative SSRI
- SNRI: Duloxetine or Venlafaxine


#### Second line pharmacological treatment of anxiety

- Pregabalin: Evaluate patients carefully for a history of drug abuse before prescribing and observe patients for development of signs of abuse and dependence. Discontinue, gradually, if ineffective at 3 months. Propranolol is not recommended by NICE guidance for management of anxiety.
- Propranolol can only help symptoms of anxiety such as palpitations and sweating, it does not mitigate the anxiety itself and has significant potential for sleep disorders and depression. If used it should be used only as needed for these symptoms and reviewed for effectiveness and adverse effects, with consideration of discontinuation once a treatment for the underlying condition is in place. Evidence does not support its use in panic disorder. Avoid use in those with Asthma, and COPD using beta-agonists.

Specialist advice only:

- Antipsychotics
- Sedating antihistamines
- Imipramine / Clomipramine for OCD / BDD
- MAOIs e.g. Phenelzine / Moclobemide
- Lisdexamfetamine in binge eating disorder


### Drug treatment of PTSD for adults (Specialist advice only)

- Venlafaxine ✓ Specialist Initiation Only
- Sertraline ✓ Specialist Initiation Only
- Propranolol SR ✓ Specialist Initiation Only

Consider antipsychotics such as Risperidone ✓ Specialist Initiation Only, in addition to psychological therapies to manage symptoms for adults with a diagnosis of PTSD if:

- they have disabling symptoms and behaviours, for example severe hyperarousal or psychotic symptoms **and**
- their symptoms have not responded to other drug or psychological treatments.

Nightmares in PTSD can respond to Prazosin ✓ Specialist Initiation Only or Doxazosin ✓ Specialist Initiation Only given at bedtime.

#### Medication choice – children aged 5 years and over and young people

(Note: use of medicines for treating ADHD is off-label in children aged < 5).

- they cannot tolerate methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine or
- their symptoms have not responded to separate 6-week trials of lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate, having considered alternative preparations and adequate doses


#### Medication choice – adults

(Note: product licenses vary for adults between preparations and if pre-existing or new diagnosis)

- they cannot tolerate lisdexamfetamine or methylphenidate or 
- symptoms have not responded to separate 6-week trials of lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate, having considered alternative preparations and adequate doses.


#### ONLY on advice of tertiary specialist ADHD service:

- guanfacine for adults
- clonidine for children with ADHD and sleep disturbance, rages or tics
- atypical antipsychotics in addition to stimulants for people with ADHD and coexisting pervasive aggression, rages or irritability


#### Medication choice – people with coexisting conditions

Offer the same medication choices to people with ADHD and anxiety disorder, tic disorder or autism spectrum disorder as other people without ADHD.

For person with ADHD experiencing an acute psychotic or manic episode:

- stop any medication for ADHD
- Consider restarting or starting new ADHD medication after the episode has resolved, considering the individual circumstances, risks and benefits of the ADHD medication.

Be cautious about prescribing stimulants for ADHD if there is a risk of diversion for cognitive enhancement, appetite suppression or a risk of stimulant misuse or diversion.

After titration and dose stabilisation, prescribing and monitoring of ADHD medication can be carried out within primary care.

When methylphenidate medication is not available due to ongoing supply issues please maintain patients on a similar formulation to avoid destabilisation.

Sodium valproate should never be started in any woman or girl unless alternative treatments are not suitable. If it is prescribed a Pregnancy Prevent Programme must be in place. Follow latest advice for contraceptive use for men prescribed sodium valproate to avoid exposure pre and post conception.

### Pharmacological interventions for mania/hypomania

### Pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression

(with specialist advice) consider:

- If already taking lithium, optimise treatment using lithium blood level monitoring.

If not already taking lithium and still unwell, consider adding lithium and optimising treatment using lithium blood levels.

If already taking sodium valproate* (and not a woman of CBP) consider increasing the dose within the therapeutic range


### Pharmacological prophylaxis of relapse in Bipolar disorder

(with specialist advice): Consider, with the individual, the medication that has been helpful during episodes of mania or bipolar depression and if to continue this longer term.

If not already taking offer lithium as a first-line, long-term pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder and:

- if lithium is ineffective, consider adding valproate* (if not woman of CBP)
- If lithium is poorly tolerated, or is not suitable (for example, because the person does not agree to routine blood monitoring), consider valproate* (if not woman of CBP) or olanzapine, or quetiapine.

Consider the long term adverse effects of the medication and plan for physical health monitoring appropriate to the medication, including blood level monitoring for lithium.

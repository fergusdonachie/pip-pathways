## 1. Allergic and inflammatory eye conditions

- Sodium Cromoglicate 2% Eye Drops – prescribe as Opticrom® in primary care 10ml (most cost effective size)

### Corticosteroids

The severity of the inflammation determines the choice of steroid.

Topical steroids should not be used for undiagnosed red eye. If red eye is due to herpes simplex, corticosteroids will aggravate this condition possibly leading to loss of vision or even loss of the eye.

- Prednisolone acetate 1% Eye Drops (most potent)
- Dexamethasone 0.1% Eye Drops
- Betamethasone 0.1% Eye/Ear/Nose Drops – prescribe as Vistamethasone® brand in primary care
- Prednisolone sodium phosphate 0.5% eye drops
- Fluorometholone eye drops* (least potent)
- Loteprednol 0.5% eye drops – ✓ Specialist Initiation Only

* Steroid eye drops can raise intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and therefore precipitate glaucoma in patients pre-disposed to chronic simple glaucoma. Evidence suggests that fluorometholone is less likely to raise IOP though this may be due to reduced penetration of the cornea.

## 4. Disorders of bone metabolism

For further please refer to the following reference sources and local protocols

- DG RefHelp > Osteoporosis
- https://www.nhsdghandbook.co.uk/medical-handbook/osteoporosis
- SIGN 142 https://www.sign.ac.uk/media/1741/sign142.pdf


### Fracture risk assessment

Management has shifted from diagnosing osteoporosis by bone density definition (lumbar spine or hip bone density 2.5 standard deviations or more below the young adult mean value for women, reported as T score <-2.5 by DEXA scan) to assessing and reducing fracture risk.

A DEXA scan is recommended as part of the fracture risk assessment if already identified as “increased risk” – see Referral Criteria for DEXA on RefHelp and FRAX or Qfracture risk assessment calculators.

If multiple vertebral collapses (2 or more) exclude myeloma or metastatic disease and commence treatment to reduce fracture risk regardless of bone density (DEXA not required however can be useful)


#### Safety considerations

Bisphosphonates are contraindicated where eGFR < 30ml/min for risedronate and ibandronic acid and eGFR < 35ml/min for alendronic acid

HRT dose: Menopause matters

For women who have had a hysterectomy; or receiving progestogen separately i.e. Mirena coil inserted within 5 years, or taking micronised progesterone, or medroxyprogesterone in a dose proportionate to oestrogen


### Oestrogen-only HRT – Oral Tablets


### Oestrogen-only HRT – Transdermal Patches

*note the Estradot patches are the smallest in size, are often the brand women report stick best, but are also most often associated with stock shortages


### Oestrogen-only HRT – Transdermal Gel/Spray

*Note: All formulations contain ethanol*

Peri-menopausal women with a uterus, i.e. less than 1 year since last menses.


### Sequential Combined HRT – Oral Tablets


### Sequential Combined HRT – Transdermal Patch

Combined patches are only available in medium dose strength.

Local menopause service would suggest starting treatment using half of an Evorel Sequi patch twice weekly to achieve a low dose regimen. This is an unlicensed dose but supported by local and national specialists. The cut half of the patch should be kept in a refrigerator.

For post-menopausal women, with a uterus, who have not experienced menses for 1 year+ or perimenopausal women who are amenorhoeic due to their POP/implant


### Continuous Combined HRT – Oral Tablets


### Continuous Combined HRT - Transdermal patch

- Evorel Conti - estradiol 50mcg / norethisterone 170mcg ✓ First Choice

When oestrogen and progestogen are administered separately, in order to protect against endometrial hyperplasia the dose of progestogen should be proportional to the required oestrogen dose, i.e. high dose oestrogen-containing regimens should have high dose progestogen component.

The levonorgestrel 52mg IUS system, i.e. Mirena, can be used for all licensed doses of oestrogen and current practice would be to use this for up to 5 years for endometrial protection. 14-BMS-TfC-Progestogens-and-endometrial-protection-APR2023-A.pdf


### ORAL PROGESTOGEN

Micronised progestogen should be taken at night due to side effect of sleepiness. Absorption is improved by taking with some food.

Before increasing dose of oestrogen, first worth considering the following:

- Expectations—are the symptoms likely to be hormone related, or are life stresses more relevant
- Address any diet and lifestyle factors which may be contributing to menopausal symptoms if appropriate, such as smoking, alcohol, caffeine, high carbohydrate, sugary diet, lack of exercise.
- Addition of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy may help for flushes, anxiety, low mood, irritability, sleep disturbance https://www.womens-health-concern.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/02-WHC-FACTSHEET-CBT-WOMEN-FEB-2023-A.pdf
- If brain fog is a prominent symptom, the following leaflet may be helpful, explaining that brain fog is common, may or may not respond to HRT and does resolve https://www.imsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ENGLISH-WMD-Leaflet.pdf
- If using patches: are they adhering, any skin irritation, consider site application—buttocks provide best absorption
- If using gel ensure applying to thighs and letting soak in for 10-15minutes prior to dressing

## Assessment

Patient presenting with history of palpitations

Clinical History:

- Circumstances prior to and during the episode of palpitations.
- Duration and frequency of palpitations.
- Description of the palpitations (patient to tap out rhythm if possible).
- Associated symptoms (breathlessness, chest pain, syncope or near syncope).
- History of heart disease or other medical conditions.
- Use of prescribed or over-the-counter drugs.
- Lifestyle factors.

Examination:

- Check heart rate and rhythym
- Check for murmurs suggestive of valvular disease
- Assess for signs heart failure - raised JVP, basal crepitations, peripheral oedema

Tests:

- FBC, U&E, TFT, LFT, HbA1c, Lipids.
- 12 lead ECG

## Primary care management


### AF on ECG

Manage via atrial fibrillation pathway


### Normal ECG (or ectopics only and no risk factors*)

Manage potential lifestyle causes:

- Stress
- Caffeine
- Alcohol
- Smoking
- Drugs that can exacerbate palpitations
- Menopause

Low risk symptoms:

- Skipped beats
- Slow pounding
- Thumping beats
- Short episodes fluttering (< 20s)
- Single episode of palpitations

These are likely to respond to lifestyle modification and can generally be managed in primary care without further investigation.

- History of syncope or near syncope.
- Palpitations precipitated by exercise.
- Family history of sudden cardiac death under 40 years.
- Abnormal ECG.
- Pregnant patients with palpitations.
- Accompanying chest pain or lightheadedness.
- History or physical signs of structural heart disease, heart failure, or hypertension.

 

## Who to refer


### Normal ECG - ongoing symptoms despite initial lifestyle management

- Arrange ECG Monitoring via SCI Gateway...DGRI...Cardiology...Palpitations Referral:

Physiologist will triage referral for appropriate investigation based on the referral information

- Daily symptoms - 24hr Holter ECG
- Several times a week - 48-72 hour monitor
- Weekly symptoms 7 day holter
- Less frequent - event recorder

If normal, holter results will be sent direct back to referrer.

If abnormal, holter results will be sent by the Physiologists to Cardiologist for review, a copy will be sent to GP.


### Abnormal ECG and or risk factors*

- Refer cardiology

Urgent Referral to Cardiology:

- History of syncope or near syncope.
- Palpitations precipitated by exercise.
- Family history of sudden cardiac death under 40 years.
- Resting ECG abnormalities.
- Accompanying chest pain or lightheadedness.
- History or physical signs of structural heart disease, heart failure, or hypertension.
- Pregnant patients with palpitations.

Routine Referral to Cardiology:

- Recurrent sustained tachyarrhythmia, AF, or flutter.
- Symptoms consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
- Ventricular ectopics if:

underlying heart disease is suspected from clinical assessment or ECG
- ectopics are very frequent or ventricular tachycardia is suspected

## Who not to refer

- Patients with isolated palpitations, a normal ECG, and no associated risk factors or symptoms can be managed within primary care.

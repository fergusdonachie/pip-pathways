## Introduction
                Warning
### Digital Interventions
The Space in Coronary Heart Disease from Depression and Anxiety programme has been designed and tailored for individuals living with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) who are experiencing co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety.
The programme aims to relieve these symptoms of depression and anxiety by:
 - Developing more flexible ways of thinking, not only in relation to the individual’s condition but in other aspects of their life
 - Increasing awareness and understanding of emotions in the context of living with CHD
 - Increasing activity and motivation in daily life, in the context of physical limitations that can occur when living with CHD
The programme is accessible 24/7, allowing users to access the programme anytime that suits them, in the comfort of their own home if they choose. The programme features a number of interactive activities to offer a safe space to put key learnings into practice.

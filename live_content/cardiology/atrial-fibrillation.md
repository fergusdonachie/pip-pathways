## Introduction
                Warning
                            ### 
Assessment                                
Patient Presentation:
 - New cases of atrial fibrillation who are hemodynamically stable.
 - Asymptomatic AF detected during routine review.
 - AF with symptoms of palpitation or dyspnoea on exertion.
Confirm AF with ECG:
 - Resting 12 lead ECG or rhythm strip ≥ 30 seconds from handheld device or smartwatch.
Assess Stroke Risk:
 - Use CHA2DS2-VASc score to determine thromboembolism risk.
                            ### 
Primary care management                                
Heart Rate Control:
 - Heart rate >110bpm without heart failure: Beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker (e.g., bisoprolol, atenolol, verapamil).
 - Heart rate <110bpm and asymptomatic: No immediate anti-arrhythmic required; consider 24-hour tape to assess overall rate control.
 - Heart rate >110bpm with heart failure: Consider digoxin or beta-blocker as appropriate, with reference to local guidelines.
Oral Anticoagulant Therapy:
 - Initiate based on CHA2DS2-VASc score and patient discussion.
 - For mechanical heart valves or moderate/severe mitral stenosis: Initiate Warfarin.
Lifestyle Advice:
 - Encourage weight loss for overweight patients (BMI >27kg/m²).
 - Encourage physical activity and moderate exercise.
 - Discuss moderation or abstinence from alcohol.
 - Advise minimising caffeine intake.
                            ### 
Who to refer                                
 - Criteria for Rhythm Control and Cardioversion:
 - Symptomatic AF despite adequate rate control.
 - Young age (<65 years).
 - Inadequate rate control despite measures or intolerance of these.
 - Structural heart disease on echocardiography.
 - AF and co-existing heart failure.
 - Symptomatic paroxysmal AF requiring a rhythm control strategy.
                            ### 
Who not to refer                                
 - Controlled and Asymptomatic AF: Patients with controlled heart rates and no symptoms can be managed within primary care.
 - Low CHA2DS2-VASc Score: Patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 (♂) or 1 (♀) may not require immediate referral unless undergoing specific procedures like cardioversion or ablation.

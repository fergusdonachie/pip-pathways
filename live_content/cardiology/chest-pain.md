## Assessment

All patients presenting with suspected ischaemic chest pain should have a clinical assessment, examination, PMHx and risk factor profile.

Initial investigations include:

- FBC
- U&E, LFT, TFT, Lipids
- HbA1c
- ECG - please attach to referral

## Primary care management

If referring for consideration of angina diagnosis:

- Provide the person with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate to use for the relief of symptoms while they are waiting for specialist assessment.
- Instruct the person that if they experience chest pain they should:
    - Stop what they are doing and rest.
    - If symptoms persist after 5 minutes use their glyceryl trinitrate as instructed.
    - Take a second dose after 5 minutes if the pain has not eased.
    - Call 999 for an ambulance if the pain persists, or earlier if the pain is intensifying and the person feels unwell.
- Consider prescribing aspirin (75 mg daily), Atorvastatin 80mg and other anti-anginal medication as appropriate until the diagnosis is confirmed.
- Manage cardiovascular risk factors, including lifestyle advice

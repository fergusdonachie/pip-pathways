## Assessment

Patient Presentation: Patients who have had episodes of transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) and do not have a firm diagnosis of uncomplicated faint, situational syncope, orthostatic hypotension, or epileptic seizures.

Initial Assessment:

- Detailed history of TLoC including any previous events.
- Medical history and any family history of cardiac disease or inherited cardiac conditions.
- Drug therapy at the time of TLoC and any subsequent changes.
- Clinical examination, including full cardiovascular examination and measurement of lying and standing blood pressure.
- 12-lead ECG and examination of previous ECG recordings if available.

## Primary care management

Refer for Ambulatory ECG via SCI Gateway...DGRI...Cardiology...Community Holter - please attach ECG! 

- Physiologist will triage referral for appropriate investigation based on the referral information:

Daily symptoms - 24 hour holter 
- Several times a week: Holter monitoring (24 - 72 hours).
- Weekly symptoms: 7 day holder.
- Less frequent: Event recorder.

Holter results:

- All holter results will be passed to the cardiologist and the GP will receive a letter with a management plan based on the results

General Information for Patients:

- Discuss possible causes of their TLoC.
- Explain benefits and risks of tests offered.
- Review results of tests performed.
- Discuss reasons for further investigations.
- Explain the nature and extent of uncertainty in the diagnosis.

Fitness to Drive:

- Advise patients who have experienced TLoC and are referred for cardiac assessment not to drive until their assessment is concluded.
- Refer to DVLA guidelines for assessing fitness to drive.

## Who to refer

- Suspected Structural Heart Disease: Refer to cardiology for further investigation.
- Suspected Cardiac Arrhythmia: Arrange for appropriate cardiology referral.
- Unexplained Syncope: If syncope is exercise-induced, arrange for exercise testing unless contraindicated.
- Recurrent TLoC with Unclear Diagnosis: Consider referral for neurological assessment if psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or psychogenic pseudosyncope are suspected.

## Who not to refer

- Firm Diagnosis in Primary Care: If the diagnosis is clear and management can be undertaken in primary care, such as uncomplicated faint or situational syncope.
- Single Episode of TLoC with Clear Cause: No referral necessary if the episode is isolated and the cause is identified and managed.

## Introduction

Current NICE/SIGN/BTS guidance recommends all new asthma treatment to be with a combined inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA) regime for patients age 12 and over. For any new patients see the treatment algorithms on DGRefHelp.

Patients who are well controlled on their existing asthma treatment do not need to be swapped, although the option should be discussed with them at routine asthma review.

Patients who are poorly controlled on a 'legacy' asthma treatment should be moved to maintenance and reliever treatment (MART) treatment and then titrated up or down using the current management algorithms

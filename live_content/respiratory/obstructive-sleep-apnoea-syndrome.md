## Introduction

Firstly, assess if the patient simply snores, or has symptoms of OSAS. 

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome should be suspected in patients with:

- Daytime somnolence (this is the key symptom and is not the same as tiredness/fatigue)
- Witnessed apnoeas
- Unrefereshing sleep
- Snoring/choking

Other potential symptoms are:

- Fragmented sleep
- Unexplained morning headaches
- Unexplained nocturia
- Impaired concentration

Associated co-morbidities

- Obesity
- Hypertension
- AF, Stroke

## Assessment

Assess the symptoms above in the history.

Examine for contributing/exacerbating factors:

- BMI
- BP
- Neck circumference (collar size)
- Micrognathia (small jaw)/retrognathia (abnormal jaw positioning with mandible set back from the maxilla)
- Signs of respiratory disease

Bloods:

- FBC, U&E, TFT, HbA1c, ferritin, B12, bicarbonate (a normal bicarbonate is helpful in suggesting against ventilatory failure)

Scores can be helpful. An Epworth score of > 10 suggests 'abnormal' somnolence. 

## Primary care management

Patients should be advised about driving - Recommendation is that patients with daytime somnolence suspected to be due to OSAS should not drive. They should be directed to DVLA sleepiness guidance - 'Tiredness can kill: Advice for drivers (INF159)'. They should not be advised to notify DVLA until the diagnosis is confirmed.

- Patients with overweight or obesity should be advised on weight loss. 10-15% weight loss results in a 50% reduction in OSAS symptoms so weight loss should be the key treatment for these patients, including referral to weight management clinic, if appropriate.
- Advise stopping smoking
- Advise reducing alcohol
- Advise on sleep hygiene (Sleepio app can be helpful)

## Who to refer

Refer patients with abnormal Epworth score (>10) and history suggestive of OSAS to sleep clinic via SCI Gateway...DGRI...Respiratory Medicine...Sleep Study

Patients with normal Epworth score (< 11) but still with a very good history of apnoeas and history suggestive of OSAS, particularly those who you feel may be minimising their symptoms.

Useful information in referral letter (helps with prioritisation):

- Are they a professional driver?
- Documented Epworth score
- Details of significant co-morbidities such as unstable cardiac disease
- Document that you have advised re driving
- Details of sleep pattern - patients with erratic sleep patterns as cause of sleepiness should deal with that first

Patients who are professional drivers or with significant co-morbidities will be seen urgently so it is important to ensure this is clear in the referral.

## Who not to refer

Do not refer:

- Patients with insomnia
- Patients with poor sleep hygiene/erratic sleep patterns as cause for sleepiness
- Patients with snoring alone
- Patients under 16 - refer to paediatrics instead

It is best to discuss patients with a potential parasomnia with respiratory first as they may be best referred to the tertiary sleep clinic in Edinburgh.

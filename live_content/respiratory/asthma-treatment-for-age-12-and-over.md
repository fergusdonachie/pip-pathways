## Introduction

- Maintenance and Reliever Treatment (MART) and Anti-inflammatory Reliever (AIR) treatment uses the same inhaler for regular treatment and as required use - i.e., no salbutamol inhaler is prescribed.
- Formoterol has an equivalent onset of action to salbutamol. Other LABAs can’t be used.
- MART has been shown to be equivalent or better than traditional regimes with separate preventer. and reliever but if patients drop themselves down to reliever only then ICS/formoterol PRN only has been shown to be as effective as regular ICS, whereas salbutamol alone has been shown to increase the risk of asthma exacerbation and death.
- PRN only dosage of ICS/formoterol is now licensed in the UK as AIR.  It is used widely worldwide and recommended by current NICE/SIGN/BTS Guideline 2024.
- AIR is only recommended for age 12 and over (Symbicort 200/6, WockAIR 160/4.5 and DuoResp Spiromax 160/4.5 are all licensed inhalers for AIR from age 12).

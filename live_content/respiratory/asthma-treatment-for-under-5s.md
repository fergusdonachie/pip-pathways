## Diagnostic trial of treatment

Asthma diagnosis is challenging in under 5s. Objective testing is difficult. Diagnosis should be clinical with a trial of treatment.

## Step 1 - Trial of paediatric low dose ICS plus SABA

#### Initial treatment with low dose inhaled steroids (plus SABA)

#### Preparations:

Formulary items in blue. Formulary items which are more environmentally friendly in green.

**Plus salbutamol DPI or MDI as reliever**

**Always prescribe an appropriate sized spacer with any MDI inhaler.** Easychamber spacers are the formulary choice

## Review after 8-12 weeks

Trial of treatment should be reviewed after 2-3 months.

#### If treatment has not been effective at step 1:

- check inhaler technique and adherence
- check whether there is an environmental source of their symptoms (for example mould in the home, cold housing, smokers or indoor air pollution)
- review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely.

If none of these explain the failure to respond to treatment, refer the child to a specialist in asthma care.



#### If treatment has been effective:

- Stop treatment and review again in 3 months

If symptoms recur then diagnosis confirmed. Restart at paediatric low dose ICS and titrate as needed as below

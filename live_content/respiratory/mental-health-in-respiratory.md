## Introduction


### Digital Interventions

The **Space in Lung Conditions** from Depression & Anxiety programme has been designed and tailored for individuals living with Lung Conditions who are experiencing co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety.

The programme aims to relieve these symptoms of depression and anxiety by:

- Focusing on developing more flexible ways of thinking, not only in relation to the individual’s condition but in other aspects of their life
- Increasing awareness and understanding of emotions in the context of living with Lung Conditions
- Increasing activity and motivation in daily life, in the context of physical limitations that can occur when living with Lung Conditions

The programme is accessible 24/7, allowing users to access the programme at a time that suits them and in the comfort of their own home.

All vignettes, personal stories and examples used throughout the programme are from the perspective of an individual living with lung conditions. The user is also provided with a number of activities to enable them to become more aware of their mood and to understand their situation.

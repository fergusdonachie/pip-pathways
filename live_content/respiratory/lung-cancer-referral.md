## Introduction

In most cases where lung cancer is suspected, it is appropriate to arrange an urgent chest xray before urgent referral to a chest physician.

However, **a normal chest x-ray does not exclude a diagnosis of lung cancer**.

In patients with a history of asbestos exposure, mesothelioma should be considered.

### Refer for urgent suspicion of cancer chest x-ray for any of the following:

- Any unexplained haemoptysis
- Unexplained and persistent symptoms (3 weeks or longer) 1 or more symptoms for ever smokers or those exposed to asbestos, 2 or more otherwise:

change in cough or new cough
- breathlessness
- chest/shoulder pain
- loss of appetite
- weight loss
- hoarseness (constant with voice never normal)
- fatigue

***** if CXR normal, refer via Head & Neck pathway ****** if CXR normal, consider alternative diagnosis including other cancers



## Refer Urgent Suspicion of Cancer

### Urgent suspicion of cancer referral

- Chest x-ray suggestive/suspicious of lung or pleural cancer (including unilateral pleural effusion, pleural mass and slowly resolving consolidation)
- Unexplained haemoptysis (arrange USoC CXR in parallel but no need to wait for result)
- Consider referral despite a normal chest X-ray:

In smokers:

Breathlessness with weight loss or appetite loss
- Chest pain with weight loss or thrombocytosis

Patients with weight loss and thrombocytosis together or smokers with weight loss and appetite loss should be considered for referral to Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Service

Refer via SCI-Gateway...Respiratory...DG-HN Lung Cancer Referral.

It is helpful for follow on imaging to ensure there is a recent (within 3 months) FBC and U&E.

It is helpful for a decision on clinic slot to include details on functional level as below to ensure patients are not directly appointed to bronchoscopy when other appointment would be more appropriate.

In people with features suggestive of cancer including suspected metastatic disease, but no other signs to suggest the primary source, consider Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Service referral.

## Introduction

Paediatric patients who require admission to hospital may be at risk of deterioration on the journey and consideration needs to be given to the mode of transfer - ambulance or taken by parents by car.

There are no clear criteria to make that decision and it should be made by the referring clinician with input, if required from the receiving clinician.

The NICE traffic light tool can be helpful but is hugely over-sensitive if used rigidly2

PEWS score is not validated for pre-hospital assessment1 but the process of calculating the score can be helpful in flagging abnormal observations.

In particular SpO2 is helpful in assessment of children with respiratory disease. Documented low SpO2 is likely to mandate ambulance transfer.

## Normal paediatric vital signs

SpO2 < 94% is abnormal in PEWS score

## Primary care assessment

It is helpful to assess and document:

- Heart rate
- Respiratory rate
- Capillary refill time
- SpO2
- General behaviour - irritable/drowsy/floppy/alert

## Admission process

To arrange admission call paediatric receiving at DGRI switchboard

Discuss with on-call paediatrician

Advise the parents to take the child direct to paediatrics, not via emergency department

If admitting via ambulance, paramedics will take the child to the ward or to resus in ED depending on their presentation.

**Note that both medical and surgical (including urology) assessments are arranged via paediatric receiving.**

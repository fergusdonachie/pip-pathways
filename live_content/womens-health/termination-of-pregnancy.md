## Overview


> **WARNING:** Warning

## Confirmation of pregnancy

Most patients with an unplanned pregnancy will have already carried out a pregnancy test. If they have already had a positive test and the history is consistent with pregnancy, then referral can be made and a repeat pregnancy test is not required.

## Referral

Patients requesting termination of pregnancy, or requesting further discussion aroundtheir options, should be referred to ourselves by telephone call. Please phone Women’s Outpatients, DGRI on **01387 241200** to obtain an appointment.

When you or the woman phones to self refer they do not get an appointment, they are told they will be contacted by the staff within 72hrs for initial nursing consultation and advised this will be longer if referred on a Thursday/Friday due to the department being closed at the weekend.

We do not post out appointments for this clinic. Once the appointment has been made, please either post or fax through a referral letter or use SCI gateway and, when possible, post a signed green abortion certificate to Women’s Outpatients, DGRI .

For patients in the west of the region, please still phone the Women’s Outpatients, DGRI number given above. Whenever possible, an appointment will be offered at the Galloway Community Hospital. If no “soon” appointment is available at GCH, patients will be offered an appointment at the Women’s Outpatients, DGRI .

If gestation is clear from the history, please do not refer before 6 weeks gestation since we may not be able to confirm that the pregnancy is viable or intrauterine and a further appointment may be needed. If gestation beyond 12 weeks is suspected, please ask for an urgent appointment.

**Patients are welcome to self refer by phoning 01387 241200.**

Please make it clear to patients that the initial appointment is for discussion and counselling around the options. An initial consultation will be done by phone. If the patient is unsure about her decision, a further appointment with ourselves can be made. A scan is may be carried out at the first visit to establish pregnancy viability and gestation but is not required if the date of last menstrual period is accurate, has regular periods, no bleeding or any abdominal pain.

A self taken low vaginal swab is taken to screen for Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea. **It is very helpful if this can be checked by yourselves at the time of referral.**

## Procedure

Once the decision has been made to go ahead with a pregnancy termination, arrangements are made for:

- Early medical management at home is offered for patients living within 30 minutes of DGRI or GCH, and who are less than 10 week's gestation.
Patients who met the criteria for home management will first attend DGRI/GCH for a face/face appointment for the administration of Mifepristone. 
- During this appointment patients are then given a supply of Misoprostol to return home to self-administer 48 hours later and this is where the abortion takes place.

For most patients having medical or surgical termination, only day-case attendance is required.

Patients who request termination of pregnancy and are between 20 and 24 weeks gestation are currently referred to BPAS. Consultation may be offered in Glasgow but any procedure is carried out in England.

## Contraception

We aim for the majority of our patients to have effective contraception commenced before discharge, with appropriate emphasis being placed on Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC).

Contraceptive implant, depo-provera injection and oral contraceptive of choicecan be provided on the first visit of the procedure.

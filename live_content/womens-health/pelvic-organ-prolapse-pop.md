## Overview


> **WARNING:** Warning

## Types of POP


##### Anterior compartment prolapse

- Urethrocele - prolapse of the urethra into the vagina
- Cystocele - prolapse of the bladder into the vagina
- Cystourethrocele - prolapse of both urethra and bladder


##### Middle compartment prolapse

- Uterine prolapse - descent of the uterus into the vagina
- Vaginal vault prolapse - descent of the vaginal vault post-hysterectomy
- Enterocele - herniation of the Pouch of Douglas (including small intestine/omentum) into the vagina


##### Posterior compartment prolapse

- Rectocele - prolapse of the rectum into the vagina

## Grading of POP


##### POP quantification system:

- Stage 0 - no prolapse
- Stage I - most distal portion of the prolapse is >1cm proximal to the level of the hymen
- Stage II - most distal portion of the prolapse is
- Stage III - most distal portion of the prolapse is
- Stage IV - complete vaginal eversion


##### Degree of uterine descent:

- 1st degree - cervix visible when the perineum is depressed – prolapse contained within the vagina
- 2nd degree - cervix prolapsed through the introitus with the fundus remaining in the pelvis
- 3rd degree -  procidentia (complete prolapse) – entire uterus is outside the introitus

## Diagnosis of POP


##### History:

- Specific symptoms related to POP
- Symptoms effect on the patient’s quality of life
- Any modifiable risk factors for POP?excess weight
- chronic cough
- constipation

Initial examination should include:

- Pelvic examinationobserve the woman at rest and while straining
- examine the woman both standing and supine
- examination should be done with an empty bladder

## Management of POP

Treatment is unnecessary in women who are asymptomatic.

Conservative management should be considered 1st line.

- Lifestyle advice / treatment to reduce modifiable risk factors should be givenweight loss
- treatment of constipation
- smoking cessation – may improve chronic cough

- Patients with stage I-II prolapse should be offered referral to the women’s health physiotherapist for pelvic floor muscle training: Megan Alexander - Dumfries; Vari Vance - Stranraerpatients who have previously had surgery for POP are still suitable for physiotherapy referral
- patients will be referred by the physiotherapist directly to gynaecology if she thinks they would be more appropriate to manage the patient

- Vaginal estrogen will not cure prolapse but should be considered if postmenopausal since:discomfort may be related to vaginal atrophy rather than prolapse
- if surgery required, improved healing with estrogenised epithelium
- used with supporting ring pessary facilitates pessary change and reduces granulation tissue

- Patients with stage III-IV prolapse should be offered trial of vaginal pessarythis can be done in the GP surgery if someone has the skills
- patients can be referred to gynaecology for initial pessary referral if no one feels confident doing this in the surgery
- once a pessary has been fitted and there have been no issues between changes the patient will likely be discharged to GP for further changes

Surgical management is offered to patients who:

- have a large symptom burden
- have declined conservative management
- failed to respond to conservative management

Patient choice should be taken into account when making the referral.

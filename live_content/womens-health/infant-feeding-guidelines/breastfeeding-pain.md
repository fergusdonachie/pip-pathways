Pain when breastfeeding, although common, is never “normal”. Pain may be due to a variety of causes – sometimes more than one.

A very common reason in the early days is a suboptimal attachment of baby at the breast. These babies often present with faltering growth, frequent feeds lasting one hour or more and/or sore, damaged nipples. Please DO NOT recommend alternative supplementation/expressing. This presentation requires a full breastfeeding assessment and support from a midwife, health visitor or a member of the infant feeding team (please refer to infant feeding team as above).

Other causes of nipple/breast pain to consider may include:

- Thrush (see below)
- Nipple trauma (from poor attachment/latch/baby with tongue-tie) - full assessment can be carried out by the infant feeding team.
- Bacterial infection of cracked nipple (see mastitis)
- Eczema/psoriasis
- Vasocompression or Raynaud’s
- Milk bleb
- Blocked duct/mastitis/abscess (see mastitis)

It is normal for infants to lose up to 10% of their birthweight in the early days; they should return to birthweight by 3 weeks. For any child losing weight, assess: feeding, wet and dirty nappies and behaviour. Check the child is being weighed on a hard surface and plotted on the right centile chart (i.e. for breastfed/bottlefed babies).

Faltering growth is not a reason to stop breastfeeding. Refer to the infant feeding team if any concerns in a breastfeeding mother; do NOT suggest top-ups or switching to formula without consulting the infant feeding team. If immediate concerns that the child is unwell or there is an underlying disorder, refer to paediatrics.

For more information about diagnosing, monitoring weight and managing faltering growth, see the NICE guidelines

Ankylglossia (tongue-tie) does not necessarily cause feeding difficulties. Refer breastfeeding mothers to the infant feeding team for a breastfeeding assessment and support to optimise positioning and attachment initially. Onwards referral to ENT can be organised by the infant feeding team if they feel that the tongue-tie is affecting feeding.

The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life, followed by complementary introduction of solids alongside continued breastfeeding thereafter. Milk is the main source of nutrition for infants up to one year, and has ongoing benefits thereafter. Breastmilk is a complex living fluid which varies from mother to mother and even by time of day. See https://www.human-milk.com/ for more information on the components of human breast milk.

Early introduction of solids has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity in later life.

Cow’s milk or alternative milk substitutes should not be offered before 1-year-old in breast or formula fed babies. There is no evidence of nutritional benefit to support stage 2 or 3 “toddler milk”.

“Weaning” does not mean stopping breastfeeding. First Steps nutrition has a wealth of information for mums and babies about healthy starts, including some free recipe books.

**Night feeds**

Waking at night to feed is normal for the first year and beyond. See this video from Swansea University “Should babies feed through the night” . If parents are looking for advice re night weaning, please direct them to the infant feeding team to discuss ways to manage this.

##### Vitamin supplements

It is recommended that breastfed infants are given a daily supplement of vitamin D (8.5-10mcg) with the addition of Vitamins A and C from 6 months. This is currently ProHealth drops (Vit D) available free to all children under 3 from the Health Visiting service. Infants taking more than 500ml of first infant formula a day do not require this as formula milks are fortified with vitamin D.

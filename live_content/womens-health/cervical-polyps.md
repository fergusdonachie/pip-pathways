## Introduction

Cervical polyps are common benign lesions of the cervix, found in about 4% of the gynaecological population.

They may be endocervical or ectocervical:

- Usually asymptomatic but may be associated with inflammatory smears, impaired smear quality, and abnormal vaginal bleeding
- Rarely malignant (< 1 in 200)

## Assessment

- Most commonly found at the time of routine cervical smear-taking
- Any abnormal bleeding needs to be investigated and managed to exclude other, more serious, causes

 

## Management

It is recommended that polyps be removed. This is usually a simple process which can easily be performed in general practice.

- >1.5 cm, arrange gynaecology referral
- Most polyps, ranging in size between 1 cm and 1.5 cm, can simply be grasped using sponge forceps, then twisted repeatedly until the polyp separates from the cervix
- Place the polyp in formalin and send for histological examination
- Heavy bleeding is very uncommon following the procedure
- Removal of the polyp is usually painless as polyps do not have a nerve supply
- Advise patient to avoid tampons and vaginal intercourse for 2 days

 

## Recurrent polyps

If recurrence occurs, the polyp can be managed in the same way, providing it has a similar appearance.

## Overview


> **WARNING:** Warning

Adapted from BASHH UK national guideline for the management of PID (June 2011) and current practice in Sexual Health Department, Nithbank, Dumfries.

## Features suggestive of PID

- Lower abdominal pain, typically bilateral
- Deep dyspareunia
- Abnormal vaginal bleeding, including post coital, inter-menstrual and menorrhagia
- Abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge
- Adnexal tenderness/cervical motion tenderness
- Fever ≥ 38**°**C

 

## Admission

Consider admission in following:

- Lack of response to oral treatment
- Clinically severe disease
- Pregnancy
- Intolerance to oral therapy
- Presence of tubo-ovarian abscess

 

## Differential diagnoses

Consider:

- Ectopic pregnancy
- Acute appendicitis
- Endometriosis
- Ovarian cyst/rupture/torsion
- UTI
- Functional pain

 

## Investigations

- If sexually active, offer and encourage pregnancy test and STI testing including HIV (patients may initially fail to disclose sexual activity)
- Consider emergency contraception
- Triple swabs

high vaginal for culture
- endocervical for culture (absence of pus cells has negative predictive value of 95% for PID)
- endocervical for chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR testing

 

## Treatment

- Delay increases risk of sequelae e.g., infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain
- Outpatient treatment as effective as inpatient therapy for clinically mild-moderate PID
- All recommended regimens are of similar efficacy, however, consider need for gonococcal cover and select regimen with cover (see ‘Treatment’ below). Higher risk of gonorrhoea in:

young adults
- previous gonorrhoea
- known contact with gonorrhoea
- female with male partner who has sex with men
- sexual contact overseas
- severe symptoms

 

## Outpatient treatment

 

- Complete total of 14 days treatment for both regimens
- If you suspect gonorrhoea/high risk for gonorrhoea, give **regimen 1**
- For alternative outpatient regimens please consult BASHH guidelines

 

## Inpatient treatment

 

- Complete total of 14 days of treatment for all regimens
- The **arrows** indicate suggested IV to oral therapy 24 hours following clinical improvement – to complete total of 14 days treatment
- Two alternative regimens given below as per BASHH guideline if first line unsuitable for any reason or unavailable. For IV to oral switch using these regimens please speak to microbiology

 

 

## Partners and Sexual Health follow up

- Current male partners of women with PID should be offered STI testing and where appropriate, treatment for chlamydia +/- gonorrhoea
- Up to 75% cases PID not associated with chlamydia/gonorrhoea therefore partners who test negative should be offered broad spectrum empirical therapy (eg azithromycin 1g single dose)
- Patients with PID and their male partners should be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until the female has completed the treatment course and if 1g single dose azithromycin is used to treat the partner then sexual activity should not resume for 7 days
- Patients who test positive for gonorrhoea should all be discussed with Sexual Health who can assist in following up the patient as they will require a test of cure three weeks following treatment commencing

 

## Intrauterine contraceptive devices

- FSRH recommends against IUCD removal in cases of PID except in those with lack of clinical response within 72 hours – in these cases consider removal
- Oral emergency contraception may need to be considered where IUC removed
- Conception can occur in women having an IUS removed at any time if condom-less sex has occurred in the 7 days prior to removal
- Conception can occur in women having an Cu-IUD if condom-less sex has occurred in the current menstrual cycle in the 7 days prior to removal unless the Cu-IUD is removed within the first three days of a cycle.

## Introduction

Most cases of Type 2 Diabetes can be prevented or delayed with weight loss, dietary improvements and increased physical activity.

As of June 2019, individuals diagnosed with pre-diabetes (identified as having Impaired Fasting Glycaemia or Impaired Glucose Tolerance) can be offered the opportunity to attend the Let’s Prevent programme. Let’s Prevent is a structured and evidence-based programme, developed by the Leicester Diabetes Centre (who also developed DESMOND), for people with pre-diabetes.

## What is Let’s Prevent?

- Letâs Prevent is there to help a person develop their own understanding of pre-diabetes, what it means for them and how they might make small lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes.
- Let's Prevent is run over two half days (two 3-hour sessions) and held at local community venues â it is important that individuals can attend both days.
- Two facilitators (with health and wellbeing backgrounds and knowledge of the local area) deliver Letâs Prevent to a small group (up to ten people).
- The facilitators provide up-to-date and evidence-based information about the causes, effects and options for managing pre-diabetes. It will also be an opportunity to meet and share experiences with others.
- If a person would like to bring a partner, friend or family member to help them feel more at ease, they are very welcome.
- If a person has any additional support needs, please let the facilitator know in advance and they will do their best to accommodate these.

Letâs Prevent is informal and friendly and the facilitators are there to make people feel welcome and comfortable about attending so please encourage people to get in touch if they have any questions prior to signing up or if they have any additional needs.

Individuals who show an interest in attending Letâs Prevent will be sent an opt-in letter once the referral is made.

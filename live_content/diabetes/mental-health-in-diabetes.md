## Introduction

### Digital Interventions

**Space from Diabetes** is a tailored online intervention aimed at individuals living with diabetes who are experiencing co-morbid symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Space from Diabetes (IAPT) is an interactive and practical programme that provides psychoeducation, tools and activities to reduce the impact of co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety in a safe and confidential space.

The Space from Diabetes (IAPT) programme has therefore been designed specifically with users living with diabetes as well as symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in mind. Diabetes-specific information, validation and normalisation of the emotional and social impact of diabetes is incorporated into the program, facilitating users to understand the link between their mental and physical health. Tailored personal stories accounts and examples of individuals living with diabetes and co-morbid depression and/or anxiety are used to illustrate and normalise difficulties encountered, while making these relevant to this specific population.

## Introduction

- **Consider insulin-based treatment** or a **sulfonylurea** (requires access to home blood glucose monitoring and driving advice).
- **Review and step down** once blood glucose is within target range and stable.
- **Contact Diabetes Centre** for advice

- Assess and optimise cardiovascular risk
- Renal function (eGFR, ACR)
- Baseline foot assessment
- Refer to DESMOND
- Add high priority Code for Type 2 Diabetes which triggers eye screening
- Consider Diabetes Remission Programme
- Set treatment goals - HbA1c < 58 is default but higher target may be appropriate (e.g. frailty). Initial aim may be diabetes remission - HbA1c < 48.

- **Metformin + Dapagliflozin**

- Start medication at diagnosis rather than lifestyle changes alone unless patient very motivated
- Start Metformin 500mg OD and increase by 500mg weekly to 2G daily as tolerated.
- Once tolerability confirmed add Dapagliflozin 10mg OD - no need to check HbA1c before adding

- **GLP-1 receptor agonist** (**Semaglutide** (**Rybelsus**)1.5mg, increasing to 4mg after 1 month then 9mg if needed) OR
- **DPP-4 inhibitor (Sitagliptin 100mg) **

**Note: GLP-1 - Ensure up to date eye screening. If overdue arrange this before starting. OK to use in background retinopathy.**

- **Sulfonylurea**
- **Pioglitazone**

**Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist** if living with obesity (if not already used)

- HbA1c remains above target despite optimised non-insulin therapy, or
- symptomatic hyperglycaemia, significant weight loss, or catabolic features, or
- contraindications/intolerance limit other options.

- **Metformin AND**
- **Dapagliflozin AND**
- **Injectible Semaglutide**

- Lower threshold to add a **GLP-1 receptor agonist** early.

- If **eGFR <20**: consider a **DPP-4 inhibitor (Sitagliptin 25mg)**; if not effective/appropriate, consider **pioglitazone** or **insulin-based treatment**.
- For other CKD stages, follow the renal thresholds in local/NICE guidance.

- Frailty increases adverse event risk from SGLT-2 inhibitors, consider **metformin alone** (if tolerated).
- Consider **DPP4 inhibitor (Sitagliptin)** as add on.
- Prioritise the **smallest effective number** of medicines at the **lowest effective dose**.
- Avoid hypoglycaemia-prone options where possible.

- **Ask about pregnancy plans** at diagnosis and at every review.
- Discuss need for **tight glycaemic control** prior to conception.
- **Early discussion with specialist diabetes team** recommended for optimisation of control and medication choice.
- If pregnancy occurs:

**Stop all glucose-lowering medication except metformin** at confirmation of pregnancy.
- **Urgent referral** to specialist diabetes antenatal service.
- **Urgent referral** to eye screening team
- **Start insulin promptly** under specialist guidance.
- **Provide Libre sensor** as per national guidance.

## Diabetes drugs cribsheet

## Renal impairment prescribing

## Stepping down treatment

- **Usually continue metformin** if tolerated (weight-neutral, no hypo risk).
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists:**

**Continue** if there is meaningful benefit (weight loss and/or improved glycaemic control or CV protection).
- **Stop** if there is *no meaningful benefit*, poor tolerability, or treatment burden outweighs benefit.

- **Recurrent hypoglycaemia or falls risk:** reduce/stop **sulfonylurea** and/or down-titrate **insulin** first.
- **Metformin:** continue if tolerated; **stop only** if eGFR <30, significant AKI risk, or severe intolerance.
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists:** continue if clearly beneficial and tolerated; consider stopping if:

persistent GI intolerance / dehydration risk
- no meaningful benefit
- frailty/treatment burden outweighs benefit

- **Pause dapagliflozin** during acute illness, dehydration, reduced intake, or suspected AKI. Restart when well and eating/drinking normally.
- **Pause metformin** during dehydration or AKI risk; restart once well and renal function stable.
- **Pause GLP-1 RA** during severe vomiting or poor oral intake (AKI risk).

## Symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer
- Abdominal mass
- Palpable ano-rectal mass or unexplained anorectal ulceration
- Persistent (more than four weeks) change in bowel habit especially to looser stools - not simple constipation
- Abdominal pain (4 weeks) with weight loss (5%) (also consider upper GI cancer)
- Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (Hb low and ferritin <30mg/L)
- Repeated ano-rectal bleeding without obvious anorectal cause
- Any blood mixed with stool

## Assessment
Assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer should include:
- **Digital rectal examination** - it is important to identify a potentially obstructing low rectal tumour so they are seen in clinic rather than direct to colonoscopy
- **Abdominal examination**
- **FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT**
- **qFIT**
- Note: qFIT not required for referral of palpable anorectal or abdominal mass or unexplained anorectal ulceration but still helpful to send
- **Do not request CEA or faecal calprotectin**
- **Do not arrange qFIT for patients without symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer above**

## Referral Pathways
There are three referral pathways for patients with suspicion of colorectal cancer:

### 1. Direct to test colorectal pathway
This is a direct to test pathway for patients meeting the criteria below. Aim is for referral to test within 10 days.

#### Mandatory tests
- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam
- Note: qFIT is not required prior to referral in patients with palpable abdominal or rectal mass but is still useful to send. You can enter 0 in mandatory qFIT field.

#### Indication
- qFIT > 20 μg Hb/g and symptoms/signs as above
- Age under 75 years
- Fit/suitable for outpatient bowel prep

#### Exclusions
- Patients on anticoagulants - i.e. warfarin/DOAC
- Colonoscopy or CT colon performed in past 12 months
- Declined or unable to complete a qFIT prior to referral
- Frail patients

#### Priority options - Urgent suspicion of cancer (USOC) only
- Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG USOC Colorectal
- Choose Direct to Colonoscopy from dropdown option

### 2. Clinic review colorectal pathway
This is a fast track pathway with escalated clinic review and diagnostic test. Aiming for referral to test within 15 days.

#### Mandatory tests
- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam
- If there is a clinical reason why DRE/qFIT cannot be completed, document this in the referral
- qFIT is not required prior to referral in patients with abdominal or rectal mass but still send one if possible

#### Indication
- qFIT > 20μgHb/g and symptoms/signs as above
- Not suitable for the direct to test pathway, e.g. due to age >75
- Patients with qFIT < 20μgHb/g but with iron deficient anaemia and meet criteria for USOC referral.

#### Exclusions
- Patients who decline qFIT

#### Priority options - Urgent suspicion of cancer (USOC) only
- Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG USOC Colorectal

### 3. General colorectal pathway

#### Mandatory tests
- qFIT, FBC, U&E, ferritin, LFT, rectal exam. Consider second qFIT

#### Indication
- qFIT < 20μgHb/g and symptoms/signs as above and significant clinical concern - **Refer Urgent**
- Patients with symptoms requiring secondary care management but without significant clinical concern - **Refer Routine**

#### Exclusions
- None

#### Priority options - Urgent/Routine/Advice
- Refer via SCI-Gateway...General Surgery...DG Colorectal

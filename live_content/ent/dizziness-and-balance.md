## Introduction

Intermittent short lived non-positional balance disturbance is very common in all age groups and is probably multifactorial. It is not indicative of any specific or treatable pathology. It does tend to settle over a year or so. Strong reassurance is often all that is required but encourage patients to keep on moving as this helps with habituation.

###### Key Messages

Multiple studies have shown that in patients referred to Balance Clinics:

- By FAR the commonest diagnoses are BPPV and Vestibular Migraine
- A THIRD to HALF of those referred have BOTH BPPV and vestibular migraine.
- Vestibular Neuritis and central neurological causes of vertigo are associated with a minority.

According to the history and examination, it may be advisable to exclude anaemia, diabetes or thyroid disorder.

The history is key, with four main groups of patients:

- Peripheral vertigo – BPPV by far the commonest
- Vestibular migraine (and less commonly other neurological conditions)
- Balance issues in the elderly (multifactorial)
- Cardiovascular causes.

The ENT balance team will ask patients to complete a symptom questionnaire online prior to being given an appointment, with the option of a phone call for those who cannot manage this.

## Primary care management

The history establishes if vertigo is:

- truly rotational (rather than light-headedness or unsteadiness)
- CENTRAL or PERIPHERAL – distinguishing may be helped by the HiNTS test (please see here for a demonstration).

**If CENTRAL, consider the possibility of an acute cerebral event.**

Prochlorperazine may be useful short-term, but prolonged use is not recommended.

Symptoms can be considered in four main symptom clusters:

- Intermittent brief episodes, precipitated by head movement or other postural changes are likely to be BPPV
- Acute onset with persistent symptoms:
Vestibular neuritis (no hearing loss) or
- Labyrinthitis (often following infection and associated with unilateral hearing loss).

- MIGRAINE can cause true rotatory vertigo associated with light sensitivity +/- headache, occurring with menstrual cycle or more frequently, a past history of migraine.
- Vestibular Migraine (previously known as migraine-associated vertigo)  - please consider migraine before any referral  to the multidisciplinary balance clinic.
- Vertigo may be associated with other central neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular events and Parkinson's Disease.

- Balance disturbance is often central or multifactorial – Consider referral to Medicine of the Elderly. The team will see patients with vertigo where that is part of a more complex picture. Some may benefit from referral to the falls pathway.

- Tend to cause dizziness without vertigo – syncopal or pre-syncopal symptoms
- Often precipitated by standing up
- Causes include postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or severe aortic stenosis

## Who to refer

- > 6 weeks dizziness and balance problems for diagnosis and management
- Probable Meniere's

## Who not to refer

- Those with vestibular migraine - initial management in primary care and refer to neurology if not responding to usual treatments.
- People over 65, particularly with co-morbidities, where the indications are that this is multifactorial consider Medicine of the Elderly referral
- Those with syncopal or pre-syncopal symptoms - please refer to Cardiology if suspicion of cardiac disease or arrhythmias.

## Assessment

A cervicogenic headache originates from neck problems, typically starting at the top of the neck and radiating into the head. It is a relatively rare cause of headache. Consider another diagnosis if there are associated symptoms.

**Signs and Symptoms**

- Headache that is triggered by neck movement
- Pain with pressure is applied to the neck or base of the skull
- Neck movements are limited and worsen the headache
- Pain on one side of the neck, shoulder, or arm
- Episodes of varying durations

## Primary care management

Patient self-management advice

- Maintain good sitting posture/avoid prolonged periods of sitting or inactivity/avoid becoming overly tired or exhausted
- If analgesia used only for a short time (risk of analgesia overuse headache)
- Keep well-hydrated throughout the day.
- Exercise regularly (avoid sleeping on the stomach).
- Schedule an eye check to ensure vision issues aren't contributing to the headaches.
- Self referral to physio if not settling with these measures

## Who to refer

For very refractory symptoms despite physio treatment consider referral to pain clinic with a view to local steroid or local anaesthetic injections
